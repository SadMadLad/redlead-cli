The Mods at /r/TrueOffMyChest will never enforce any rules that exclude any race/gender/etc. or other views from posting in /r/TrueOffMyChest. We ask that you do the same.\n# 2. Do not break sitewide rules\n* Due to the nature of this subreddit, telling anyone to kill themselves will be an automatic, permanent ban. This is a place where people come to share some of their darkest secrets, things that might already put them into a volatile mental state. Again, there is a no tolerance policy for this.\n* Posts involving pedophilia or minors in sexual situations will be removed.\n* Posts wishing violence on anyone will be removed.\n* Begging for karma is against Reddit ToS and will be removed.\n# 3. Posts must be on topic\nPosts should be personalized and written in an off my chest style.\nPosts here should not be:\n* Opinions, generalisations and blanket statements.\n* Questions, surveys or polls.\n* Requests for relationship advice.\n* Political themed posts/comments/discussions.\n* Rage bait, obviously fake stories and trolling attempts.\n* Complaining about or linking to other subreddits and users\n* Overly descriptive NSFW,fan fiction and fetish bait\nIf you're unsure that your post qualifies as personal, message the mods and ask.\n* More information on what types of posts are allowed here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/m501ud/what_does_personalized_off_my_chest_style_post/\n# 4.

Posts must be personal and in \"off my chest\" style\n* If your post isn't personal in nature or in \"off my chest\" style, it will be removed. If you want to talk about something, it either has to be directly related to you or directly impacting you - no soapboxing or hot takes/unpopular opinions.\n# 8. No financial transactions\n* Do not offer money, give money, or request money. This is a bannable offensive with zero tolerance.\n# 9. Updates must be posted in a reasonable manner\n* To prevent karma farming and spam, update posts must be minimum 3 days apart.

Joke responses at the parent-level will be removed. Accounts using AI to generate answers will be banned. Follow-up questions at the top level are allowed. (Link only responses are permitted if they are asking for a subreddit.)\nDo not answer by only dropping a link and do not tell users they should \"google it.\" Include a summary of the link or answer the question yourself.\n#Rule 2: Please try searching here before posting a new question\nTry to keep repeat posts to a minimum. As much as we love answering questions here, it doesn't help when we see repeat questions on the front page every day. You can find the questions that have come up here again and again in our [wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq).\n#Rule 3: Be Nice\nFollow Reddiquette: Be polite and respectful in your exchanges. NSQ is supposed to be a helpful resource for confused redditors. Civil disagreements can happen, but insults should not. Personal attacks, slurs, bigotry, etc. are not permitted at any time.\n#Rule 4: No medical advice questions\nNo medical advice questions\nA rule of thumb would be: Could this question or its answers make someone decide not to go see a doctor when they really should?\nIf you are asking here to avoid bothering a doctor, you probably should bother a doctor.\n#Rule 5: No trolling or joke questions\nDisallowed: questions that are joke or trolling questions, memes, just song lyrics as title, etc. \n#Rule 6: No suicide or 'was I raped/sexual assaulted/sexually harrassed?' questions\nSuicide related questions are best handled by the resources they have at r/SuicideWatch.\n#Rule 7: No self-promotion, shilling or begging\nNo trying to draw traffic to product/video/podcast/website by phrasing it in the form of a question. \nAsking for upvotes, birthday wishes, handouts, or fundraising support fall under this as well. Please see more appropriate subreddits for that. \nNo questions trying to elicit participation without learning anything of substance from the answers.\n#Rule 8: No illegal/unethical or disturbing subject matter\nNothing like \"Where can I find a copy of (movie/show/music) for free online?\" There are other places for asking that, this is not one of them.\nTasteless or disturbing questions regarding loli, pedophilia, murder, violence or other sketchy or disgusting subject matter are not welcome here. You are welcome to ask good faith questions about such topics but be aware such threads may be locked or removed if necessary to preserve the integrity of the subreddit.\n#Rule 9: No disguised rants, agenda posts, potstirring, disruptive topics\nQuestions not asked in good faith - such as a rant or hate towards any group in the form of a question, as well as leading questions, or those asked merely to promote an agenda will be removed.\nWe are a small, volunteer mod team and there is a limit to our ability to respond to brigading and trolling from Reddit at large.

All Support related threads must have a customer support ticket either currently open or recently resolved. Threads relating to support will be closed with discussion continuing in your ticket at the [SteelSeries Support Center](http://steelseries.com/support).

All RMA related tickets will be auto removed by AutoModerator.\n * **Rule 2** - Some of the mods of this sub are SteelSeries representatives. They are marked by an orange SteelSeries flair. They do not work in this subreddit full time. All time is donated by the team after regular work hours. Please respect that. Our inboxes are always full and we most definitely will not be able to get in touch with you right away. If you have an urgent matter, please open a help desk ticket! \n * **Rule 3** - Absolutely zero tolerance for foul or aggressive language. Your post will be removed immediately. A ban may follow depending on the severity.\n * **Rule 4** - Harassment, posts that are not constructive, and/or thread spamming will be removed and a ban may be issued. \n * **Rule 5** - Automoderator is currently reporting in and standing by. If your post manages to slip by the auto flair feature, please take a second and do so on your own. This helps our sub stay streamlined and quickly searchable for other on target threads. You are doing a major service to yourself and our community. 99% of all threads should get auto tagged automagically.

Did you feel *out of the loop*? This subreddit is dedicated to helping you get up to speed with the recent trends and news. \n---\n###Links to view before submitting\n-| -|\n:---:|:---:\n[Subreddit Rules](/r/OutOfTheLoop/w/rules)|[Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/)\n[Retired Questions](/r/OutOfTheLoop/wiki/index/retired_questions)|[Know Your Meme](http://knowyourmeme.com/)\n[What is a Loop?](https://redd.it/77cda0)|[Google](https://www.google.com/)\n---\n####Rules\n#1. Post title must be a current, unbiased, and coherent question\n- The title is the most important aspect of creating a post. If it's hard for other users to understand what you are asking then it will be hard to get an answer. \n - **Current** - The topic of the post you are creating must be a trending event that has happened recently.\n - **Unbiased** - Don't put your own twist on it to make it come off negative or positive. Try to be as neutral as possible. \n - **Coherent** - Write a complete question that is clear about what you are trying to ask. Don't simply put one word and a question mark. \n - **Format** - **[Include the format listed here.](/r/OutOfTheLoop/wiki/titles)**\n#2. Post must include context and resources in the body of the text\n- Context is key when trying to find a proper answer. The more we know about what you are asking, the better we can answer with more information. \n - **Context** - Add some words to your post so there is more to work with than a title. Words such as; what you saw, where you saw it, how often you saw it. \n - **Resources** - You obviously saw it somewhere; link to the thing that made you ask. Or include a screenshot. \n#3. No ad nauseam, recently reposted, or retired questions\n- Often times what you are asking has already been answered. Be sure to search the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/search), [Google](https://www.google.com/), and [KnowYourMeme](http://knowyourmeme.com/) before creating a new post.\n - **Ad nauseam** - The topic in question has been discussed extensively, and that those involved in the discussion have grown tired of it.\n - **Recently reposted** - A topic is popular and is posted multiple times within a short period of time.\n - **Retired** - The '[Big List of Retired Questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/wiki/index/retired_questions)' is a wiki page created by the mods that lists overly asked questions that have been thoroughly answered. Duplicates of retired questions may be removed.\n#4. Top-level comments must begin with \"Answer:\", and be a genuine, unbiased, and coherent answer\n- People are here to find answers to their questions. If top-level comments are riddled with memes or non-answers then no one wins. \n - **Begin with \"Answer:\"** - This helps weed out low-effort, rule-breaking comments, as well as allows the comments to be more organized.\n - **Genuine** - Attempt to answer with words; don't pop in to tell users to search or drop a link without explanation.\n - **Unbiased** - Answer without putting your own twist of bias towards the answer. However, after you leave an unbiased response, you can add your own opinion as long as it's clearly marked, starting with \"Biased:\".\n - **Coherent** - Write in complete sentences that are clear about what you are trying to say.\n#5. Be nice, follow etiquette\n- This subreddit is supposed to be a helpful place for confused redditors.\n - **Be nice** - Be polite in your exchanges, vote based on whether a comment contributes to the discussion and not on whether you agree with the opinion, etc.\n - **Follow etiquette** - When in doubt, refer to [**reddiquette**](http://www.reddit.com/w/reddiquette/).\n#6.

This includes build help, tech support, and any kind of doubt one might have about PC ownership.\r\n* You don't necessarily need a PC to be a member of the PCMR. You just have to love PCs.

[Nor did it start as one](//pcmasterrace.org/history). This is a [normal subreddit with occasional tongue-in-cheek humor elements](//pcmasterrace.org/community). We are a community where many of its members share similar opinions about the main topics, and sometimes end up having private jokes amongst ourselves. We are not a community where members feign stupidity when posting and commenting because they find it funny. You can be banned if you conduct yourself like that here.\r\n* Owning a console does not necessarily make you a ['peasant'](//pcmasterrace.org/consolepeasants).\r\n* We created Reddit's most popular [Wiki](/r/pcmasterrace/w/).\r\n* If needed, you can [message the team behind PCMR](//reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/pcmasterrace).\r\n\r\n---\r\n#[Rules](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules)\r\n\r\nFor an in-depth explanation of our rules don't forget to check our [rules wiki page](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules).\r\n\r\n* [**Rule #1**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.231) Harassment of others is strictly forbidden. We will not tolerate any kind of incitement to action against anyone, nor will we allow the posting of information that can be used to harm others (celebrities or not).\r\n* [**Rule #2**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.232) We will not allow behavior contrary to [PCMR Etiquette](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/etiquette), e.g. brigading, witch-hunting, asking for upvotes or downvotes, enabling piracy, flamebaiting, clickbaiting, intentional rudeness, text spamming, using all caps or emojis/smileys/emoticons in titles or overusing them in comments, meta-reddit or meta-subreddit drama or complaints.\r\n* [**Rule #3**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.233) Don't link to threads in other subreddits. This includes NP links and archived links. Do not attempt to circumvent this rule by any means.\r\n* [**Rule #4**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.234) Screenshots of Reddit, Facebook, Youtube, and other site's comments should have the usernames blacked out (including yours). Celebrities are the exception, as long as you respect rule #1.\r\n* [**Rule #5**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.235) No affiliate/referral links or codes.\r\n* [**Rule #6**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.236) The following will be removed at moderator discretion: \r\n - 6.1: Content that is either low quality, unrelated, especially unoriginal, or low-effort (including, but not limited to: simple website/software bugs, steam/product reviews, comedic product/system specs, steam gift messages, screenshots of conversations, internet speed test results, negligible price reductions, items that aren't PC related, even if they are named similarly or resemble it, online petitions and surveys that aren't academic in nature (and have been pre-approved by the mod team).\r\n - 6.2: Pictures of purchase or shipping related notifications and information.\r\n - 6.3: Blatant reposts/fad-chasing.\r\n - 6.4: Reaction content (images/gifs/memes), unless very high-quality/especially original.\r\n - 6.5: [Concern trolling](//goo.gl/TPnnnw).\r\n - 6.6: Feigning idiocy when posting or commenting, or linking to such content.\r\n* [**Rule #7**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.237) Age, nationality, race, gender, ability, sexuality, religion, political affiliation and economic status are all irrelevant here. All are welcome in the PC Master Race. Also, linking the PC Master Race with racial supremacy or any kind of fascist ideologies, or making distasteful analogies in this regard, is not acceptable in the slightest.\r\n* [**Rule #8**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.238) No begging. No [soft begging](https://goo.gl/4J9rq6). No Implicit or explicit trading. No buying. No Selling. No asking for valuation. No asking how or where to do these either.\r\n* [**Rule #9**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.239) Message the mods first, and wait for permission, if your post/comment is NSFW. Do not mark your post as NSFW or as Spoiler unless it actually is NSFW or a Spoiler.\r\n* [**Rule #10**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.2310) Screenshots of \"peasantry,\" including but not limited to conversations on Reddit, other websites or sms/chat screenshots where ignorance is being spewed and/or ridiculed, must be text posts.\r\n\r\n#Giveaway Rules\r\n\r\nFor an in-depth explanation of our giveaway rules don't forget to check our [rules wiki page](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_giveaway_rules).\r\n\r\n* The Master Race is generous. When doing giveaways please keep it within the bounds of our subreddit and only for subreddit members. Feel free to give prizes as you see fit, but don't mandate subscriptions or other benefits. You can post about your channel or project, but don't make it a requirement to visit, comment or subscribe to an external place to enter a giveaway or to increase the likelihood of winning.\r\n* Under special circumstances, we allow giveaways to be external and/or to require users to visit a page outside the subreddit, but that must conform to our [outside giveaway guidelines](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/rules#wiki_outside_giveaway_guidelines).\r\n* Even if you do a giveaway, you can not directly promote a specific giveaway happening elsewhere without prior mod approval.\r\n* Please [avoid posting keys in plain text or on images](/3ys6wv). Consider PMs as a safer way to hand out keys.\r\n* Users giving away physical items must provide photo proof of ownership (including their username and date) in the giveaway thread. Shipping fees must be entirely financed by the user doing the giveaway (limiting the winner's location is allowed).\r\n* No conditional (I will only giveaway if) giveaways. If you start it, someone must win it. You cannot delete your giveaway once you post it.\r\n* Giveaways shouldn't last an absurd amount of time, nor should they be absurdly difficult to enter or win.\r\n* Do not choose your giveaway winners based on the number of upvotes or downvotes they get.\r\n* Giveaways to benefit registered charities must be verified by moderators. All other requests for donations (monetary or otherwise) are not allowed as per rule #8.\r\n* Only one entry per user to any giveaway unless otherwise stated by the giveaway poster.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck the PCMR communities elsewhere:\r\n\r\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/OfficialPCMR)\r\n\r\n[Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/OfficialPCMasterRace)\r\n\r\n[Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/OfficialPCMR)\r\n\r\n[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/Officialpcmr/?sub_confirmation=1)\r\n\r\n[Steam Group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steampcmasterrace)\r\n\r\n[Steam Curator](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4771848-r-pcmasterrace-Group/ )\r\n\r\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pcmasterrace_official/)\r\n\r\n[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/officialpcmasterrace)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nChats:\r\n\r\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/pcmr)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCharity: \r\n\r\n[Folding@Home](https://pcmasterrace.org/foldingteam)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### [](#social)\r\n\r\n\u0026gt;

Keep the discussion related to Windows 11**\nPosts completely unrelated to Windows 11 will be removed. Just because something is compatible with Windows, doesn't mean this is the subreddit for it. Derailing conversations and threads is not allowed.\n* **2. Flair posts correctly**\nWe are not extremely strict with what flair you pick, but if it's very wrong we will change it. If we select another flair, don't put the original one back. Not sure what flair to use? Read [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_2._flair_posts_correctly) to help you decide.\n* **3. Do not distribute malicious programs**\nDo not purposely distribute viruses or other harmful programs or apps. Advising the use of pirated software (including piracy, activation tools, and bypasses to enable paid features) is prohibited. This also includes \"grey market\" and other activation keys from unauthorized resellers.\n* **4. Do not post Blogspam links or URL shorteners**\nBlogspam, URL shorteners, mobile links, and referral and affiliate links are not allowed. Post the full desktop link for articles and news.\n* **5. Be civil and do not troll others**\nPersonal attacks, bigotry, fighting words, inappropriate behavior and comments that insult or demean a specific user or group of users are not allowed. Posts or comments containing or seeking any identifying personal information are also prohibited. Do not engage in blatant trolling or flaming.\n* **6. Do not advertise a 3^rd party software without permission**\nIf you want to promote an app or website, you must [send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Windows11) to request permission. Include as much relevant information as you can in both the modmail and the post. This is not a marketplace subreddit, selling anything is prohibited.\n* **7. Do not promote pirated content or grey market keys**\nDo not post pirated content or promote it in any way. Encouraging or hinting at the use of sellers of grey market keys is not allowed.\n* **8. Titles must be relevant to the post**\nIrrelevant, sensationalized, or vague titles that have the pure intent of misleading or dramatizing a topic are not allowed. The relevancy of submissions' titles will be judged at the moderator's discretion.\n* **9. Do not submit reposts, low-effort posts or rants**\nReposts are not allowed. All posts and answers that can easily be found by searching this subreddit or by using a search engine will be removed at the moderators' discretion. Although we encourage healthy discussions, rants and low-effort posts that do not contribute positively to the subreddit are not allowed.\n* **10. Only post memes on Mondays. No tech support anytime.**\nMemes and other humor posts are only allowed on Mondays (UTC timezone) and they will be removed any other day of the week. Not Monday yet?

Submissions\n* ####Guidelines:\n* Submissions must be primarily news and developments relating to technology\n* [Self posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/wiki/self-post-guide) must contribute positively to /r/technology and foster reasonable discussion. Self-post cross-posts are not acceptable. Please message the moderators before attempting to submit a text/self post.\n* Submissions relating to business and politics must be sufficiently within the context of technology in that they either view the events from a technological standpoint or analyze the repercussions in the technological world.\n* ####Please do not submit the following:\n* i) Submissions violating the guidelines.\n* ii) Images, audio or videos: Articles with supporting image and video content are allowed; if the text is only there to explain the media, then it is not suitable. A good rule of thumb is to look at the URL; if it's a video hosting site, or mentions `video` in the URL, it's not suitable. \n* iii) Requests for tech support, questions or help: submit to /r/techsupport, /r/AskTechnology, another relevant community or our weekly [Support Saturday threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=flair%3ATechSupport\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all).\n* iv) Petitions, Surveys or Crowdfunding (Including ICOs) - submissions of this nature will be removed.\n* v) Submissions discussing the subreddit itself; they should be submitted to /r/TechnologyTalk, or [messaged to the moderators of the subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).\n* vi) Submissions discussing one or more incidents of customer support.\n* vii) Mobile versions of sites, url shorteners: please directly submit the desktop version of a webpage in all cases.\n* viii) Social media links/profiles/invites or promotions (eg. Facebook, BlueSky, Instagram, Threads, etc). Tweets should not be used as a news source unless an official announcement by a verified company or spokesperson. \n##2. Behaviour\n* **Remember the human** You are advised to abide by [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette); it will be enforced when user behaviour is no longer deemed to be suitable for a technology forum. Remember; personal attacks, abusive language, trolling, bad-faith abusive comments, flaming and baiting, and bigotry/hate in any form are not allowed and will be removed and the user will be banned.\n##3. Titles\n* Submissions **must** use either the articles title and optionally a subtitle. Or, ***only*** if neither are accurate, a suitable quote, which must:\n* adequately describe the content\n* adequately describe the content's relation to technology\n* be free of user editorialization or alteration of meaning. \n##4. Reddit-wide rules.\n* [All reddit-wide rules apply here](/rules). \n* **Do not [spam](/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F). No Self Promotion. Do not submit *anything* you are affiliated with (this applies to News Organizations as well)**\n***\n##Miscellanea\n* If you see a rule-breaking submission, please report it and [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology) with your reason.\n* Want to host an AMA?

No bigotry, no bullying, no harassment.\n**Keep it cute or keep it mute!**\nPlease read the following rules before posting and commenting. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us via modmail. Thanks!\n**CIVIL DISCUSSION ONLY**\nThis subreddit is for civil discussion only. While shade, wit \u0026amp; snark are welcome, bullying, harassment, bigotry \u0026amp; personal attacks are not. \nDo not attack other users for their fandom. Do not use someone's post history to attack them. Do not bait users. Treat everyone with respect. Attack the argument, not the person. Violations of this rule will result in an immediate ban.\nThis is not \"Mean Girls.\" Everyone can sit with us if they are respectful \u0026amp; engaging in good faith.\nKeep it cute or keep it mute!\n**NO ISMS / PHOBIAS / HATE SPEECH**\nWhile we support marginalized communities' rights to reclaim slurs, we do NOT support bigotry or using bigoted language to denigrate anyone. This includes but is not limited to: racism, sexism, ableism, ageism, homophobia, transphobia \u0026amp; xenophobia.\nThis subreddit is an inclusive LGBTQ+, BIPOC woman-dominated space. Bigotry is not welcome here.\n**RUMORS \u0026amp; GOSSIP**\nDo not mislead or use poor sourcing. Any unverified rumors should be clearly labeled as such \u0026amp; only cite from respected \u0026amp; reputable sources. Anything else will be removed.\nWe provide a weekly tea discussion post where you can discuss unverified gossip. Please keep it in the space we provide for you.\n**APPEARANCE \u0026amp; OBJECTIFICATION**\nNo objectification, slut shaming, slurs or derogatory insults on appearance and/or weight. \nA lot of celebrities have had work done, and many may alter their online appearances with photoshop and other filters. \nIt’s fine (and healthy!) to discuss these things in a world obsessed with beauty standards but we don’t need to be overly negative and tear someone down to do that. \nIf someone can't change their appearance within minutes, don't make negative comments. Be kind!\n**CELEBRITY CHILDREN**\nSelf-explanatory. Immediate bans for any negative comments directed to or about anyone under the age of 18. \nPhotos of celebrity children without their parents (yes this includes bday posts or creepy fan sites for celeb children) will be removed \u0026amp; the post authors will be suspended pending review.\nWe do allow photos that have been posted publicly by the parents on social media. However, be very respectful \u0026amp; don't make an entire post dedicated just to the child.\n**SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS**\nIt’s fine to share social media posts but we require the names to be blocked out unless it’s a verified account, meme, a celebrity or the name has appeared in the news (public). Posts that violate this rule will be removed until the information is hidden.\n**USE THE SPOILER FLAIR**\nSince this is a pop culture sub we will talk about new releases \u0026amp; spoilers. However, we require all spoilers to use the spoiler flair. Comments with spoilers not in a flaired spoiler post must be covered. No spoilers in the title.\n**NO META DISCUSSION**\nNo meta discussion allowed!\nWe will have regular meta \u0026amp; off-topic posts where members of the sub can talk about everything under the sun that is not celeb-related. Every other time? Stay on topic \u0026amp; keep it cute. \nIf you have suggestions or wish to vent you can always use modmail or discuss it in the areas we provide for meta chat. Repeatedly ignoring this rule will result in a ban. \nIf you decide to leave the sub, you don’t need to make a post to say goodbye.\n**NO LOW EFFORT POSTS**\nNo low effort/low quality posts or post titles. You must put in an effort! \nText posts: Descriptions are required! Share information expounding upon your title. \nLinks: Titles should have a description of what you're sharing. Otherwise leave a comment with context.\nPhotos: You must leave a comment providing context if it isn't apparent in the title. \n \n**This is to encourage discussion and because not everyone knows every pop culture reference or celebrity.**\n**NO REPOSTS**\nTo keep the conversations fresh \u0026amp; interesting, similar posts may be removed. All reposts of megathread questions/topics or pinned content will be removed. \nReposts are defined as posting the same meme, content, question, news article, etc. with similar titles, discussion questions, or the like. Do not rehash the same topic by posting something that could be a comment in a current thread.\nIf there's already a current post for the topic, you can provide updates with images/links in the comments.\n**HEALTH ANALYSIS \u0026amp; TRIGGERS**\nNo overly invasive diagnoses of strangers or suggestive commentary about their physical or mental health, including addiction. No armchair diagnosing. Be extremely mindful of the language you use. \nRespect boundaries \u0026amp; respect that your experiences are not everyone’s. Most importantly respect your own energy and know when to step back.\nFor posts with triggering content, a brief description is required in the first line of the text post (e.g. TW: Reason). Use the trigger warning post flair.\n**DEADNAMING \u0026amp; PRONOUNS**\nRespect this always, regardless of the context or if referring to someone pre-transition. If you are unsure they/them will suffice. Any \u0026amp; all wilful disrespect with this rule is a ban worthy offense. No excuses.\n**NO SPAM OR SELF-PROMOTION**\nNo links to your own social media, companies, blogs, brands, unverified news sources, etc. \nSelf created content, such as fan-art/fan-edits, are allowed \u0026amp; encouraged! There are exceptions if a video or article is a deep dive or informational. In these cases, we ask for context to open discussion on said post. Moderator discretion applies.\n**POLITICAL \u0026amp; SOCIETAL DEBATE**\nNo overly politcal posts or comments. While we do allow discussions around politics, this isn't a political sub. If it doesn't fit in pop culture, it doesn't belong here.\nThere will be times where societal discussions happen. Healthy discussion around societal topics are fine as long as you engage in good faith.\nBe respectful to others who do not share your viewpoint. If someone is purposely trolling, do not engage! Report any rule violations to the mods via the report button or modmail.\n**AGREE TO DISAGREE \u0026amp; MOVE ON**\nWhile civil discussion is encouraged, arguing for the sake of arguing \u0026amp; flame wars is not. No one needs to have the last word. Know when to agree to disagree \u0026amp; move on.\nRespect boundaries. If someone says they are done discussing things with you, do not continue to engage. If you continue, you will be subject to a ban."},{"display_name":"videos","description":"###[Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/videos#dis)\n###Our Other Subreddits\n-|\n:-:|:-:|:-:\n[Political Video](/r/PoliticalVideo)|\n###Resources [wiki](/r/videos/wiki#wiki)\n-|-|-\n:-:|:-:|:-:\n[Wiki](/r/videos/wiki/index)|[Points](/r/videos/wiki/index#wiki_points_flair_.26amp.3B_rewards)|[Rules](/r/videos/wiki/rules)|\n#Featured Sub » /r/CuriousVideos\n---\n###About \\/r/Videos [chat](https://discord.gg/videos#dis)\n* A great place for video content of all kinds.

It's okay to disagree with someone, but using ad hominem attacks instead of having an actual discussion is not acceptable.|\n|1.2 Discrimination|Attacks based on gender, sexual orientation, disability, race, nationality, ancestry, or religion are prohibited. Civil discussion is permitted, but using these traits as weapons is not allowed.|\n|1.3 Witch-Hunting|Spreading a negative campaign against a particular group of people or a specific individual by sharing their information with others is not allowed. This includes raiding servers/users.|\n|1.4 Calls to Action|Any attempts to rally the community for a particular purpose, such as voting for a poll, promoting a boycott, seeking funding or support for a cause, or advertising a petition, will be removed as it is considered a \"call to action\". This also includes requests to find certain people. However, please note that polls or contests created specifically for the subreddit are allowed.|\n|2.1 Low-effort Submissions|Moderators may remove content that is deemed as low-effort. This includes but is not limited to **quality, memes, rants, screenshots lacking info/context, vague titles, \u0026amp; posts irrelevant to Discord**. *[Full description](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/wiki/rules/#wiki_2.1_low-effort_submissions)*|\n|2.2 Safe For Work Content Only|Excessively violent or sexual content, including but not limited to death threats, explicit content, gore, or content that sexualizes or harasses other users is not allowed. However, discussing NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content is allowed as long as it is tagged appropriately and is relevant to the discussion.|\n|2.3 Client Modifications|Client modifications such as Better Discord and BeautifulDiscord are not supported and are considered a violation of Discord's Terms of Service. Therefore, we do not discuss these matters on the subreddit. Third-party add-ons like these are not safe to use. Installing any third-party software that modifies the Discord client can create vulnerabilities that may expose you to malicious code or result in the loss of your account. It is highly recommended to avoid using such software to ensure the security of your Discord account.|\n|3.1 Recently Posted Topics|Reposted topics are not allowed. Threads that focus on topics that have been discussed at high frequency, cover information from the same angle, or are covered in our FAQ pages may be removed. Please use the Reddit search bar, check /new, or the front page as this is a topic that has been largely posted/discussed recently.|\n|3.2 Advertising/Self-Promotion|No advertising/self-promoting servers, selling/buying accounts, trading, or nitro begging. Server self-promotion will result in an immediate perm ban. Advertising personal bots/projects is allowed if it does not make up a notable portion of your account history.|\n|3.3 Code Giveaways|We do not allow giveaways on this subreddit as they create spam and we cannot verify that all users receive their prizes (when required to enter). If you want to give away your code(s), please use this [post](https://redd.it/18s8fwf).|\n|3.4 Third-Party Bot Support|If you are having trouble with a third-party bot, we recommend you contact their support team. Try searching the bots name on Google as most bots have a support website or server. Some of the more popular ones are [Dyno](https://dyno.gg/discord), [Mee6](https://discord.gg/mee6), [YAGPDB](https://discord.gg/4udtcA5), \u0026amp; [Carl-bot](https://discord.gg/S2ZkBTnd8X)|\n|4.1 Account Support|This subreddit is not the appropriate place to post account-related issues/requests/complaints. If you are having an issue with Discord's product or need to contact them for any reason, please [search their support knowledge base](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us) for answers or send a ticket to Discord’s [support team](https://dis.gd/contact). If you've already sent a ticket, please be patient and wait for an answer. The support team often has a slow response time due to the number of open tickets.|\n|4.2 User/Server Report|Discord removed the trust and safety option from [dis.gd/report](https://dis.gd/report) a while ago, so the only way to report content is by doing it on Discord directly. If you believe a user/server has violated ToS, please report them/it using [these directions](https://discord.com/safety/360044103651-reporting-abusive-behavior-to-discord).|\n|4.3 Bug Reporting or Feature Requests|Technical questions and issues other users may be able to assist with are allowed, but bug reports should be shared directly with Discord. You can use the Bug Megathread pinned to the front page or submit a [bug report](https://dis.gd/bugreport). Learn about bugs [here](https://dis.gd/bugs) for instructions! While feature requests and feedback inspire awesome discussions on the subreddit, we encourage sharing them with Discord directly via a [Discord Feedback](https://dis.gd/feedback) submission. Submitting there guarantees higher visibility from the people who can implement the suggestions.|\n|5. Reddit rules|Reddit's content policy and terms of service must be followed at all times. Some of our other subreddit rules overlap with the site-wide rules, but such rules provide more information specific to r/discordapp to help you understand what kind of content is allowed. Please review proper [Reddiquette](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette) before submitting.|\n(Hover over a specific rule for more information!)\n###Modmail Disclaimer\nWe only respond to modmail sent in English.

Treat other users the way you want to be treated. Avoid straw-manning and bad-faith interpretations. Avoid presenting misinformation as factual.\n**2: No Trashposts** \nPosts deemed to be entirely without value or effort may be removed if they have not generated interesting discussions before their discovery. Users are encouraged to report posts they feel are of significantly low effort. Specifically mentioning that “Is chat GPT down posts?” will be removed. The stickied FAQ deals with that.\n**3: Self Advertising** \nPosts must be directly related to ChatGPT or the topic of LLMs. They may not be solely focused on advertising a single other LLM service. Find or establish a relative subreddit for that service.\n**4: Political Discussion** \nHaving ChatGPT create political content is completely fine. Discussion of the politics around AI and LLMs is allowed. This is not the place to discuss the merits of Trump's foreign policy or Hunter Biden’s laptop.\n**5: No NSFW Content** \nThis is a SFW sub. Any posts violating this rule will be removed, and repeated offenses may result in a ban.\n**6: AI Art**\n- Quality over Quantity: AI art submissions are allowed only if they showcase something unique, unusual, or particularly interesting. Generic memes, low-effort images, or art intended solely for karma farming will be removed.\n- Encourage Tech Discussion: Posts that include insights, techniques, or thought-provoking commentary about the AI process or technology behind the art are highly encouraged.\n- Mod Discretion: Mods reserve the right to remove posts that do not meet the above criteria.\n___\n**[Join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/rchatgpt)**\n**[Join us on Telegram](https://t.me/r_ChatGPT)**"},{"display_name":"coolguides","description":"**Post Requirements**\nTo help keep things nice, searchable, and maintainable, all posts must be prefixed with \"A cool guide\". For example, \"A cool guide about identifying poison ivy\", \"A cool guide showing how to clean your house\", or \"A cool guide for painting your living room\".\n**Defining a Guide**\nGuides are reference materials, how-tos, and/or comparison tables. It takes both content and layout to make something a guide. The layout or structure of a guide must be that so, when someone is trying to find/reference information from the guide, they can do so logically or simply. If someone has to visually bop around your guide to find what they are looking for, the guide does not pass the layout test. On top of that not all guides are created equal, many technically qualify as guides, but lack substance. Guides are typically laid out in a grid configuration of some sort or sectioned into multiple tables by a category or step of a process. Flow charts and step-by-step guides are considered guides, so are visual references that line up different types of something next to one another other.\n**Defining An Infographic**\nAn infographic is more educational in layout and content, finding something specific on an infographic is not as easy because it is designed to inform through more narrative structures. If your guide is more of a visual essay than a structured table or list, then chances are that is an infographic. Sometimes infographics can masquerade as how-to guides. \n**Remembering That Sometimes It's Grey**\nThese are the considerations the mod team use when they feel it is appropriate to remove posts. If you have questions message us, if you think a post is not a good one downvote it.\n***Subreddit Rules***\n**1. Please only post direct links to images of type .png, .jpg, and .jpeg**\n**2. Infographics will be removed.**\n**3. Nonserious/Comedy Guides Will Be Removed (better suited for /r/shittycoolguides)**\n**4. Guides must use either Reddit or Imgur as an image host**\n**5. Guides depicting harmful, dangerous, or destructive content will be removed. This includes guides describing the creation of dangerous items/materials and/or guides that are designed with the purpose to harm or hurt others do not fit the culture of this sub and will be removed.** \nIf you know the source of your guide, post it in the comments so people can know the true heros!\nMany of you might have whole folders of guides, but they are all on similar topics. Please help keep the sub diverse by not saturating the sub with one topic. If you do we may remove some of your posts in the interest of keeping a wide array of topics.\n***Lastly, always check the comments for guides. Moderators are not experts in everything so we do not always moderate for accuracy, though there are often one or two people wearing their smarty pants in the comments.***"},{"display_name":"formula1","description":"- [](/topBegin)[](#au)\n- [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/WcJsaqf) [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/f1subreddit.bsky.social) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/redditf1/)\n#\n- New to Formula 1?\n - [FAQ](/r/formula1/w/faq)\n - [Wiki](/r/formula1/w/newtof1)\n#\n- [](/beginInfoHead)Welcome to r/Formula1\n - The best independent F1 fan community[](/endInfoHead)\n - [](/countDownBeginh[](/countDownEnd)\n - [f1calendar.com](http://f1calendar.com)[LightsOuts.com](https://lightsouts.com/formula-1)\n- SIDEBAR NOTICE[](/beginInfoSched)\n\u0026gt;\nF1-bot is no longer operational.

[](#icon-cross) **Don't be an asshole / be respectful to others.**\n\u0026gt; Don't be an Asshole Pretty simple. This does not mean you can report people for saying mean things to you and hurting your feefees. We're not a safe space here, if you make a comment or an argument, be prepared to defend it if people call you out on your shit. Blatant racism, sexism, general bigotry etc. is punishable with a permanent ban.\n\u0026gt; 2. [](#icon-information) **Moderator’s Discretion.**\n\u0026gt; The mod team reserves the right to ban anyone and remove any post/comment at any time for any reason.\n\u0026gt; 3. [](#icon-information) **Low Effort Posts**\n\u0026gt; Mods will use discretion to determine if a post is worth approving for the sake of engagement, entertainment, lessons learned, just being a good question etc.\n\u0026gt; Low effort posts may include: FAQs (search the FAQ), clickbait titles, yes/no questions, what/why/where/who/when/how men questions, bathroom/underwear/what do you do with your dick questions, questions that can be googled, questions deemed too stupid, and spam. AI comments and AI content in your profile will result in a ban..\n\u0026gt; 4. [](#icon-cross) **Dating/Relationship Advice**\n\u0026gt; Do not make posts requesting dating or relationship advice, there are subs specifically centered around these topics. Do not make posts trying to figure out a specific person's actions, behavior, or thinking. We don't know them and can't speak for them. This also includes how to get over breakups, gift ideas and asking how to support your partner. Go to r/askmenadvice or r/askmenrelationships.\n\u0026gt; 5. [](#icon-cross) **Affirmation/Validation/Forever Alone/Self Deprecating/General Attention Whoreishness**\n\u0026gt; Post at your own risk because you will receive rightfully condescending and rude comments, be made fun of, and your post will most likely be removed once everyone has had enough.\n\u0026gt; This includes affirmation of your appearance, body features, personality traits or life situation, asking about what men think about this that and the other type of woman, what make up, hair color, height, BMI, astrological sign, credit score, or instrument is best/sexiest/most likely to trap a man in marriage.\n\u0026gt; 6. [](#icon-cross) **Agenda Posting/Potstirring**\n\u0026gt; Do not post a question that is obviously geared towards creating an echo chamber where you can either a) create a circlejerk about how everyone agrees with you or b) get into fights with everyone because you're right and everyone else is a shitlord/plebian/whatever. If you want to get into stupid slapfights with people, then take it somewhere else.\n\u0026gt; Do not link to other subreddits with the intention to draw attention to a certain post or comment. Only archived reddit post links will be approved..\n\u0026gt; 7. [](#icon-cross) **Medical Advice**\n\u0026gt; Medical advice is not allowed here. We recommend talking to a medical professional instead of the Internet. This includes asking why your dick does whatever it does. We're tired of talking about dicks here.\n\u0026gt; 8. [](#icon-cross) **Political Posts**\n\u0026gt; There are subs like r/politics, r/PoliticalDebate, and r/PoliticalDiscussion if you want to debate political ideas or candidates.\n\u0026gt; 9. [](#icon-cross) **Let’s talk about sex (respectfull)**\n\u0026gt; This is a sub for adults and adults like to talk about sex. That's fine. What's not fine is posts that are obviously typed with one hand (we check your profiles and see way to much of this shit, we'll know if you really have a question about toilets or if it's fetish fuel) and obvious/feeble attempts to get sexual attention from men (see rule 5). On that note.\n\u0026gt; 10. [](#icon-cross) **Self Promotion**\n\u0026gt; We do not allow any form of self-promotion or surveys on this sub. This includes OnlyFans and all similar sites, thirst trap accounts, external sites looking to farm responses for content, news articles, school projects, start ups, etc. The bot will automatically ban you if you have adult content links associated with your account - blame all assholes before you for trying to farm engagement on this sub.\n\u0026gt; 11. [](#icon-cross) **Answers From Men Only Flair**\n\u0026gt; If a post is flaired \"Answers from men only\", only men should be providing top level answers in that post.\n\u0026gt; Top level comments will be removed, other engagement will be moderated more heavily and removed at mod's discretion i.e., derailing, whataboutism, or if you're just here to fight or shit on men."},{"display_name":"sports","description":"\u0026gt; - [Get Flair](/r/sports/wiki)\n\u0026gt; #\n\u0026gt; - [Recreation](/user/caindaddy/m/recreation)\n\u0026gt; - [Bicycling](/r/bicycling)\n\u0026gt; - [Climbing](/r/climbing)\n\u0026gt; - [Disc Golf](/r/discgolf)\n\u0026gt; - [Fishing](/r/fishing)\n\u0026gt; - [Golf](/r/golf)\n\u0026gt; - [Running](/r/running)\n\u0026gt; - [Skiing](/r/skiing)\n\u0026gt; - [Snowboarding](/r/snowboarding)\n\u0026gt; - [Swimming](/r/swimming)\n\u0026gt; - [Weightlifting](/r/weightlifting)\n\u0026gt; #\n\u0026gt; - [World Sports](/user/caindaddy/m/worldsports)\n\u0026gt; - [AFL](/r/AFL)\n\u0026gt; - [Boxing](/r/boxing)\n\u0026gt; - [Cricket](/r/cricket)\n\u0026gt; - [Football](/r/football)\n\u0026gt; - [Formula 1](/r/formula1)\n\u0026gt; - [MMA](/r/MMA)\n\u0026gt; - [Olympics](/r/olympics)\n\u0026gt; - [Rugby Union](/r/rugbyunion)\n\u0026gt; - [Soccer](/r/soccer)\n\u0026gt; - [Tennis](/r/tennis)\n\u0026gt; #\n\u0026gt; - [US Sports](/user/caindaddy/m/ussports)\n\u0026gt; - [Baseball](/r/baseball)\n\u0026gt; - [Basketball](/r/nba)\n\u0026gt; - [Football](/r/nfl)\n\u0026gt; - [Hockey](/r/hockey)\n\u0026gt; - [Nascar](/r/nascar)\n\u0026gt; - [Soccer](/r/MLS)\n\u0026gt; - [College Football](/r/cfb)\n\u0026gt; - [College Basketball](/r/collegebasketball)\n\u0026gt; #\n\u0026gt; - [/r/sports](/r/sports)\n\u0026gt; #\n[GET FLAIR!](http://old.reddit.com/r/sports/wiki/flair)\n[**Rules**](/r/sports/about/rules/)\n1. **No Memes.

Artists are encouraged to post their own work. News and media for adaptations based on comic books are welcome. Read [the subreddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/wiki/index) for more information about the subreddit.\n##[General Conduct](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_general_conduct)\n\u0026gt; 1. **[Don't complain about comics you don't like or understand.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_1._don.27t_complain_about_comics_you_don.27t_like.)** - If you don't get a comic, it's probably not meant for you. Comics are often targeted at certain audiences. If you don't get a comic, odds are it wasn't meant for you. Don't whine about it; just move on to the next comic.\n2. **[Don't attack artists posting their content.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_2._don.27t_attack_artists_posting_their_content)** - It's not ok to attack artists with hateful comments meant to tear them down or try to chase them off Reddit. \n3. **[Don't make drama for drama's sake. No trolling.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_3._don.27t_make_drama_for_drama.27s_sake._no_trolling.)** - Anyone wanting to participate in this community needs to keep their comments civil. No hateful comments or posts - Any comments or posts that are racist, misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, misinformation or extremist in nature will be removed and will result in an immediate ban.\n4. **[Respect the [OC] System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_4._respect_the_.5Boc.5D_system)** - The [OC] tag is for artists wanting to submit their Original Content. False claims on others' art will get you banned.\n5. **[Respect the Report System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_5._respect_the_report_system)** - Reports are for content that breaks this sub's/Reddit's rules. False reports are given to the Reddit Admins. \n6. **[Tag NSFW content when needed.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_6._tag_nsfw_content_when_needed.)** - Content with nudity, pornography, or obvious profanity should be tagged as NSFW. \n7. **[Cite Sources.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_7._cite_sources)** - If your comic is a direct adaptation of an existing joke, tweet, post or meme, please cite the original source in the comments.\n##[What is OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_ok_to_post)\n\u0026gt; * **Comic covers or short excerpts** - *A few* scanned pages can be posted for discussion. Don't post entire comic books. Posts with too many pages will get removed.\n* **Web comic strips** - Most strips need to be linked back to original sources (i.e. the artists' websites). Don't link to [rehosted](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_rehosting) or [hotlinked](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_hotlinking) comics. Artists can use [OC] to link to their own work anywhere.\n* **Links to articles, videos, art, cosplay or music** - Content directly related to comic books or web comics, including film and TV media. \n* **Discussion topics** - Talk about past or present comic books or strips. Topics about comic-based movies or TV shows are also fine.\n* **Translations** - English translations of non-English original comics are ok as long as the translation is honest and a link to the original source is provided in a comment.\n##[What is not OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_not_ok_to_post)\n\u0026gt; * **Edits to comics that you didn't make** - Don't remove watermarks/attribution or try to \"fix\" someone else's work. Post your own original content.\n* **Stuff that just reminds you of comics without there being any real reference in the topic** - Please keep posts on topic with real comic content.\n* **Links to download complete, pirated comic books** - Please support comics by buying them.\n##[Are You A Comic Artist?](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_are_you_a_comic_artist.3F)\n\u0026gt; Content creators can get Artist Flair to display next to their account names on all of their posts.

This means letting readers know roughly what your post will be about before they click. “Question” is not a good title for a post. Neither is “Help needed”. Do not use excessive emoji characters in the titles of posts.​\n**(6)** - Displaying detailed personal information of anyone other than yourself is prohibited. Submission of content focused on ousting cheaters will be removed at the moderation team's discretion.\n**(7)** - Do not solicit medical advice.

READ ME FIRST!**][readme]\n## [Posting guidelines][wiki]\n## [Frequently asked questions][faq]\n## [Subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/about/rules)\n## [Message the moderators][message]\n----\n## Asking debugging questions\nIf you need help debugging, you must include:\n1. A [**concise but descriptive title**][debugging-title].\n2. A [**good description**][debugging-description] of the problem.\n4. A [**minimal**, **easily runnable**][debugging-posting], and [**well-formatted**][debugging-formatting] program that illustrates your problem.\n5. The output you expected, and what you got instead. If you got an error, include the **full** error message.\nSee [debugging question guidelines][debugging] for more info.\n \n## Asking conceptual questions\nMany conceptual questions have already been asked and answered. Read our [FAQ][faq] and search old posts before asking your question. If your question is similar to one in the FAQ, explain how it's different. \nSee [conceptual questions guidelines][conceptual] for more info.\n## Other guidelines and links\n1. [Frequently asked questions][faq]\n2. [Asking homework questions][homework]\n3. [Asking for code review][code-review]\n4. [Answering questions][answering]\n5. [Learning resources][learning-resources]\n6. [Other communities][other-communities]\n## Subreddit rules\n### 1. No unprofessional/derogatory speech\n- Follow [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette): behave professionally and civilly at all times. Communicate to others the same way you would at your workplace. Disagreement and technical critiques are ok, but personal attacks are not.\n Abusive, racist, or derogatory comments are absolutely not tolerated. \n See our [policies on acceptable speech and conduct](/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_acceptable_speech_and_conduct) for more details.\n### 2. No spam or tasteless self-promotion\n- When posting some resource or tutorial you've made, you must follow our [self-promotion policies](/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_self-promotion).\n In short, your posting history should not be predominantly self-promotional and your resource should be high-quality and complete. Your post should not \"feel spammy\".\n Distinguishing between tasteless and tasteful self-promotion is inherently subjective. When in doubt, message the mods and ask them to review your post.\n Self promotion from first time posters without prior participation in the subreddit is explicitly forbidden.\n### 3. No off-topic posts\n- Do not post questions that are completely unrelated to programming, software engineering, and related fields. Tech support and hardware recommendation questions count as \"completely unrelated\".\n Questions that straddle the line between learning programming and learning other tech topics are ok: we don't expect beginners to know how exactly to categorize their question. \n See our [policies on allowed topics](/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_allowed_topics) for more details.\n### 4. Do not ask exact duplicates of FAQ questions\n- Do not post questions that are an exact duplicate of something already answered in the [FAQ](/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq).\n If your question is similar to an existing FAQ question, you MUST cite which part of the FAQ you looked at and what exactly you want clarification on.\n### 5. Do not delete posts\n- Do not delete your post! Your problem may be solved, but others who have similar problems in the future could benefit from the solution/discussion in the thread. \n Use the \"solved\" flair instead.\n### 6. No app/website review requests or showcases\n- Do not request reviews for, promote, or showcase some app or website you've written. This is a subreddit for learning programming, not a \"critique my project\" or \"advertise my project\" subreddit.\n Asking for code reviews is ok as long as you [follow the relevant policies](/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_asking_for_a_code_review). In short, link to only your code and be specific about what you want feedback on. Do not include a link to a final product or to a demo in your post.\n### 7. No rewards\n- You may not ask for or offer payment of any kind (monetary or otherwise) when giving or receiving help.\n In particular, it is not appropriate to offer a reward, bounty, or bribe to try and expedite answers to your question, nor is it appropriate to offer to pay somebody to do your work or homework for you.\n### 8. No indirect links\n- All links must link directly to the destination page. Do not use URL shorteners, referral links or click-trackers. Do not link to some intermediary page that contains mostly only a link to the actual page and no additional value.\n For example, linking to some tweet or some half-hearted blog post which links to the page is not ok; but linking to a tweet with interesting replies or to a blog post that does some extra analysis is.\n Udemy coupon links are ok: the discount adds \"additional value\".\n### 9. Do not promote illegal or unethical practices\n- Do not ask for help doing anything illegal or unethical. Do not suggest or help somebody do something illegal or unethical. \n This includes piracy: asking for or posting links to pirated material is strictly forbidden and can result in an instant and permanent ban.\n Trying to circumvent the terms of services of a website also counts as unethical behavior.\n### 10. No complete solutions\n- **Do not** ask for or post a complete solution to a problem.\n When working on a problem, try solving it on your own first and ask for help on *specific* parts you're stuck with.\n If you're helping someone, focus on helping OP make *forward progress*: link to docs, unblock misconceptions, give examples, teach general techniques, ask leading questions, give hints, but no direct solutions.\n See our [guidelines on offering help](/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_offering_help) for more details.\n### 11. Don't ask to ask.\n - Ask your questions right here in the open subreddit. Show what you have tried and tell us exactly where you got stuck.\n We want to keep all discussion inside the open subreddit so that more people can chime in and help as well as benefit from the help given.\n We also do not encourage help via DM for the same reasons - that more people can benefit\n### 12. Low Effort Questions\n - **Do not ask** easily googleable questions or questions that are covered in the documentation.\n This subreddit is not a proxy for documentation or google.\n We do require effort and demonstration of effort.\n This includes \"how do I?\" questions\n### 13. No AI (chatGPT etc.) generated messages/comments. No questions about chatGPT/AI generated code.\n - Such posts/comments will be removed without warning and the poster of ai generated content will be instantly banned.\n---\n [readme]: /r/learnprogramming/comments/61oly8/new_read_me_first/?st=j48sevyh\u0026amp;sh=1af2421a\n [wiki]: /r/learnprogramming/wiki/index\n [faq]: /r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq\n [message]: http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23learnprogramming\n \n [debugging]: /r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_getting_debugging_help\n [debugging-title]: /r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_writing_a_good_title\n [debugging-description]: /r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_writing_a_good_description_of_the_problem\n [debugging-posting]: /r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_posting_code\n [debugging-formatting]: /r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_formatting_code\n [conceptual]: /r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_asking_conceptual_questions\n [homework]: /r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_asking_homework_questions\n [answering]: /r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_offering_help\n [code-review]: /r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_asking_for_a_code_review\n \n [learning-resources]: /r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_other_resources\n [other-communities]: /r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_related_communities\n \n [rules]: /r/learnprogramming/wiki/rules/\n [rules-self-promotion]: /r/learnprogramming/wiki/rules#wiki_2.3A_no_spam_or_tasteless_self-promotion\n [rules-off-topic]: /r/learnprogramming/wiki/rules#wiki_3.3A_no_off-topic_posts\n [reddiquette]: https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette"},{"display_name":"Scams","description":"**Welcome to r/Scams, a subreddit for all your scam identification needs!**\n \n* This is a help forum - bad advice will get you banned, and we do not consider \"just joking\" to be a defense of advice that would be harmful if followed.\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n---\n**Posting guidelines**:\n* You should post details in order to receive quick advice. Include details like: what the person sent you, details included in texts/emails/in-person conversation, etc. The more detail, the better. If you post screenshots, you should also copy and paste the text from the screenshot into your post so that the text shows up on Google and other search engines. Make sure you redact all personal information from your screenshots.\n* Given the nature of this subreddit, you should treat any external links as suspicious, and you should be careful visiting any unfamiliar websites. \n* Don't post links to websites you think are scams. Put the website address in the title of your post, so it's safe for everyone.\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n---\n**Posting rules:** \n* **Rule 1: Be civil** - Please ensure that all your posts and comments in this subreddit are civil and use appropriate and respectful language at all times. Flaming, name-calling, bullying, harassment, or anything else that could break site-wide rules or offend or disturb others is prohibited. Regardless of whether a scam has been posted here once or a thousand times, remember there is a real person behind the screen. We are a landing page for people new to Reddit, and people in crisis. Be kind, not snarky.\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n* **Rule 2: Report recovery scammers** - Anyone suggesting contact via DM, or the services of a professional hacker to help recover funds must be reported. Remember: never take advice in private, because we can't look out for you. If you take advice in private, you're on your own.\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n* **Rule 3: No personal information** - Sharing personal information is strictly forbidden in this subreddit. Offending posts will be immediately removed. Please censor any personal information in posts and comments. This includes phone numbers, addresses, photos, and full names. The exception to this rule is people who present themselves as public figures (ex: celebrities, internet personalities, etc.)\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n* **Rule 4: No spam** - This subreddit is a place for meaningful and useful discussions about scams. Nonsensical and useless content, memes, advertisements, solicitation, or any other spammy, off-topic content is not allowed. Sarcasm doesn't fly: we don't allow jokes on serious posts. Posts asking to verify online stores should be submitted to other topic-specific subreddits. If you don't know where: r/findareddit\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n* **Rule 5: No low effort posts** - Low-effort posts will be removed. Please ensure that all posts posted to this subreddit are of decent quality and on-topic. Screenshots without transcripts, links to external articles with no information in the body of your post, link posts to outside websites, memes, jokes, or anything else that isn't useful is not allowed.\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n* **Rule 6: No uncensored nudity or photos of dead people** - Don't post nudity without censoring it. Don't upload photos of dead people without censoring them, regardless of the NSFW tag. All NSFW posts will be queued for moderation, so be patient.\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n* **Rule 7: No personal army requests** - We are not your personal army. You cannot request members of the sub to mass report accounts, mass text/call phone numbers, or otherwise use our large sub for your own personal gain.\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n* **Rule 8: No private message requests** - Don't ask for contact via private message. We need to keep the community safe from recovery scammers or bad advice. Remember: never take advice in private, because we can't look out for you. If you take advice in private, you're on your own.\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n* **Rule 9: No scambaiting** - This is a scam identification subreddit. Scambaiting, interacting with known scammers or anything that encourages wasting scammers' time, etc, on posts and comments, is not encouraged or allowed.

Have you heard of those Youtubers who use computer-generated avatars? They're called Virtual Youtubers!\nThis is a subreddit for you to discuss and share content about them!\n***\n**TO CURRENTLY ACTIVE VTUBERS:** \n* Feel free to [get in touch](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/VirtualYoutubers) if you're interested in the subreddit's Weekly VTuber Spotlight (see stickied post).\n* Please see Rule 4a for information on self-promotion, and Rule 10a for information on verification. Note that verification is ***not*** required to self-promote here.\n***\n#Rules:\n*[Please see the Full Rules page for an in-depth explanation of the rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/wiki/index/rulesandguidelines)*\n1. **Be nice!** \n a. Follow [reddiquette](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette). Be civil and respectful, do not engage in personal attacks or use offensive language.\n2. **Keep it Relevant!**\n a. Posts must be related to Virtual Youtubers. If a post's only relation to Virtual Youtubers is in its title, the post will be removed.\n b. Discussions about politics or other controversial topics that are tangential or unrelated to the post they are on are not permitted.\n3. **Specific Content Restrictions**\n a. The following content is prohibited in /r/VirtualYoutubers: \n • AI artwork \n • Begging for subscribers \n • Asking for money \n • Commissions \n • Reposts of content posted within the last 90 days \n • Low effort content \n b. Machine translations are generally permitted in /r/VirtualYouTubers, but may be subject to removal if either: \n • A more accurate human translation exists. \n • The machine translation is found to be significantly wrong, even if a human translation does not exist. \n4. **Self-Promotion and Fan Content Restrictions**\n a. Self promotion posts, fan content, and clips about a single VTuber are restricted to two posts per user within 24 hours.\n b. Milestone posts are limited to 500/1000/5k/10k/50k/etc subscribers/followers on a VTuber's primary video or streaming platform unless specifically exempted by the moderation team. If everyone in a branch of a corporation has cleared a milestone, new members clearing it may not be posted until one month after their debut.\n5. **Keep Posts Clear, Accurate, and Sourced**\n a. Posts should use the flair which best matches their content.\n b. A post's title should clearly indicate what it is about. Posts with vague or clickbait titles may be subject to removal.\n c. When posting something that you did not create, your post must credit the original creator in the title *and* provide a link to the original source. If you do not know what the source is, don't post it or [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/VirtualYoutubers) for help.\n6. **Keep It Clean!** \n a. Suggestive content should be tagged NSFW.\n b. Upper frontal nudity is only permitted to be posted by Verified VTubers self-promoting and must use the \"Adult Content\" flair in addition to being tagged NSFW. \n c. Full frontal nudity, sexually explicit content, or content with a pornographic intent not otherwise exempted may not be posted.\n7. **Rules on Past and Alternate Identities**\n a. Discussion of a VTuber's alternate identities must be spoiler tagged, and it should be clear what the spoilers contain. Posts must be flaired 'Alter-Ego Discussion' and may not include such info in the title. This extends to hinting about such information. Within 7 days of a re-debut, flair and spoiler requirements are waived for that specific VTuber.\n b. Discussion of IRL accounts of VTubers is only allowed if it's related to their VTuber activities.\n c. Doxxing is strictly prohibited.\n8. **Limit the Drama!**\n a. Posts about allegations or drama shall be restricted to information confirmed or alleged directly by the people involved. Posts about petty drama may be removed.\n b. Speculation, rumors, and opinions from third parties, are restricted to the comments of other posts or the weekly discussion thread, unless specifically sanctioned by the moderation team.\n c. Content that is intended to harass or to promote harassment or spread misinformation is not permitted under any circumstance.\n9. **Don't Be a Pirate!**\n a. Content that is behind a paywall may not be posted in /r/VirtualYoutubers. This includes membership content, content from patreon or similar websites, paid concerts, voice packs etc.\n b. Information from membership streams or other paid content may only be discussed in /r/VirtualYouTubers if explicitly permitted by the VTuber.\n c. Unauthorized rehosting of other people's content may be subject to removal.\n10. **Verification**\n a.

VTuber business entities must verify themselves to the moderation team before posting entity related news or advertisements (eg auditions). Individuals applying to said entities are reminded to exercise caution when providing said entities with personal information.\n***\n#Stream Etiquette\n- [Stream etiquette guide by Lyger](https://lyger.github.io/scripts/vtuber/etiquette.html).\n- Keep in mind that most Japanese VTubers are not fluent in English. Use short sentences and keep your message as simple as possible. You can use [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) if you want to write something in Japanese.\n- Do note that VTuber chat culture is very different from Twitch chat culture. Please remember to observe the rules in the stream's description. In general, please refrain from interacting with other viewers or talking about things unrelated to the stream.\n- Please do not talk about the entertainer behind the avatar during their streams or on their platforms. We are there to support the VTubers and enjoy what they have to offer, not to meddle in their personal lives.\n***\n#Getting you started\nTo those who are new to VTubers and don't know where to begin; here's a few channels you could check out to get you started:\n**Japanese-speaking VTuber Groups**\n- [Hololive JP](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJFZiqLMntJufDCHc6bQixg)\n- [Nijisanji JP](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX7YkU9nEeaoZbkVLVajcMg)\n**English-speaking VTubers**\n- [Hololive EN](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCotXwY6s8pWmuWd_snKYjhg)\n- [Nijisanji EN](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-JSeFfovhNsEhftt1WHMvg)\n- [VShojo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1aw_NTHltGdNEPTHsVDiQ)\n**OG Pioneer Japanese VTubers**\n- [Kizuna Ai](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4YaOt1yT-ZeyB0OmxHgolA)\n- [Mirai Akari](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMYtONm441rBogWK_xPH9HA)\n- [Computer Girl Siro](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLhUvJ_wO9hOvv_yYENu4fQ)\n***\n#Useful Links\n- /r/Hololive\n- /r/VShojo \n- /r/PhaseConnect\n- /r/Vspo\n- /r/PRISMProject\n- /r/globie_hub\n- /r/VNUofficial\n- [Japanese VTuber Activity](https://virtual-youtuber.userlocal.jp/)\n- [VTuber Subtitles List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X3xwpUsixaBAn5JZe0Pg_KGSvVUvgqWnmXxukwTvZ84/edit#gid=0)\n- [VTuber Subtitles Twitter](https://twitter.com/VTuberSubtitles)\n- [Official Hololive Website (Schedule)](https://schedule.hololive.tv/#hololive)\n- [Official Nijisanji Website (Schedule)](https://www.itsukaralink.jp/)\n- [VTuber Resources \u0026amp; Commissions](https://vtresources.carrd.co/)\n- [Some Tips For Supporting Smaller/Independent VTubers](https://redd.it/jfupc6)\n- [Discord List](https://pastebin.com/nRayvuVP)\n - [Holofans](https://discord.gg/holofans)\n - [2434 club (Nijisanji)](https://discord.com/invite/M3tvbBh)\n- /r/Live2D \n***\n#Filter by Flair\n- [News/Announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/search?q=flair%3A%22News%2FAnnouncement%22\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n- [Ongoing/Upcoming](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/search?q=flair%3A%22Ongoing%2FUpcoming%22\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n- [Translated/Subtitled](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/search?sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;q=flair%3ATranslated%2FSubtitled)\n- [Fluff/Meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/search?sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;q=flair%3AFluff%2FMeme)\n- [Fan Content (OP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/search?q=flair%3A%22Fan+Content+%28OP%29%22\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n- [Fan Content (Non-OP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/search/?q=flair%3A%22Fan+Content+%28Non-OP%29%22\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all)\n- [Music](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/search?q=flair%3A%22Music%22\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n- [Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/search?q=flair%3A%22Discussion%22\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n- [Support](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/search?q=flair%3A%22Support%22\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n- [Meta](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/search?q=flair%3A%22Meta%22\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n- [Ask Me Anything](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/search?q=flair%3A%22Ask+Me+Anything%22\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n***\n^Shoutout ^to ^/u/Cyber_Apocalypse ^for ^redesigning ^the ^subreddit!\n***\n^Banner ^artwork ^taken ^from ^[@mansyontintai](https://twitter.com/mansyontintai/status/951368773314912256)"},{"display_name":"GenZ","description":"#####[OFFICIAL DISCORD](https://discord.gg/4U5jDAc) | [OFFICIAL MINECRAFT SERVER](https://old.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/daaqci/calling_all_zoomers_the_official_rgenz_minecraft/)\n###[Night Mode](http://nm.reddit.com/r/genz)\n##[Light Mode](http://old.reddit.com/r/genz)\n####[OFFICIAL DISCORD](https://discord.gg/4U5jDAc)\n#ABOUT\n/r/GenZ is a place for members of Generation Z (born 1995-20**) to hang out and post any content related to our generation.\n#RULES\n(Please click the relevant rule to read a full breakdown)\n1.

MIL \u0026amp; Mom-related Posts Only**|More specifically, YOUR MIL / Mom. Other people can absolutely be involved but they cannot be given their own thread. Currently step-moms, and grandmothers are included in the umbrella \"mom\" term. If you know your SO is also part of the problem you're welcome to mention it, but otherwise users are barred from offering SO-related advice.\n**2. Only MIL/Mom Gets a Nickname**|Nicknames are reserved for MILs (or moms). All others must use the acronym dictionary listed in the sidebar or a basic descriptive name (e.g. Father, Best Friend). Please do a search before naming your MIL. FIL names prior to May 2016 are grandfathered in.\n**3. OP Comes First**|Be kind, be respectful, be supportive. Remember the human. OP’s will select a flair for their post indicating the kind of support that they need. Comments that violate the spirit of that request will be removed. You can find more information on post flairs and what they mean in the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/justnomil/wiki/index#wiki_post_flair_guide).\n**4. One Chapter at a Time**| For those who are posting past stories, refrain from creating more than one thread in a 24 hour period per mother-figure. We encourage you to use up all the text space when making your post--don't feel like you need to break a long story into ten chapters when it would fit into one post. No need to apologize for the long post; no one's going to read it who doesn't think it's worth reading, so rest assured you are wasting no one's time! Only one person per account is allowed, and those multiple accounts that are discussing the same person must stick to once a day as well. For those posting live updates requiring immediate guidance, if you are within 6 hours, please update your original post.\n**5. No \"JustNo\" Behavior**|We have a zero tolerance policy for armchair advice (medical, legal, or otherwise) that is damaging, factually incorrect, or egregiously shitty, sexism, racism, xenophobia, transphobia, ableism, stereotyping, slut/body/kink-shaming, anti-vaxx bullshit, and just generally being a butt. No posting personal info, including faces or identifying tattoos or marks. Any comment with \"cartoon-level\" violence MUST: A) indicate that you don't actually suggest users do what you suggest, and 2) include actual, usable advice.\n**6. Use Content Warnings when Applicable**|For posts with triggering content a brief description is required in the first line of the post (e.g. CW: Reason). It is recommended to add \"Content Warning\" or \"CW\" to your title as well, but not required. Titles containing words that are particularly likely to be triggering (see [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/justnomil/wiki/index#wiki_6._use_trigger_warnings_when_applicable)) will be auto-filtered.\n**7. We do not allow for posts or comments that request money or gifts.**|This includes linking to amazon wishlists, gofundmes, appeals on your profile or subreddit, or links to other sites. We also do not allow commentors to offer money or gifts or to start fundraising on an OP's behalf. This includes DMing an OP or via chats.\n####ACRONYMS\n||| \n:-:|:-: \n(M/F/B/S)IL|Mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law; a preceding S indicates a step relationship.\nD(H/W/S)|Damn Husband, Damn Wife, Damn Spouse. While in most places it stands for \"Dear\", there usually isn't a lot of behavior deserving a sweet term of endearment in this sub. Could also stand for \"Dear Son/Daughter\", usually OP will clarify.\nSO/OH|Significant Other, Other Half\nLO|Little One.\nF (plus acronym)|Future (JustNoMIL is not responsible for any other word you choose to supply here in your mind.)\nBEC|[Bitch Eating Crackers.](http://i.imgur.com/JSNegZP.png) Someone so irritating that even normal things, such as eating crackers, annoys the shit out of you.\nLC/VLC/NC|Low-Contact/Very Low-Contact/No Contact, respectively. Used to describe the degree to which one has cut a certain family member out of their lives. May also include SC - Structured Contact, although this one is very rare in our sub.\nGC/SG|[Golden Child](http://outofthefog.website/top-100-trait-blog/2015/11/4/favoritism), [Scapegoat](http://outofthefog.website/top-100-trait-blog/2015/11/4/scapegoating). The Golden Child is the favorite child of the personality disordered MIL. Nothing they do is wrong, so they tend to fall in line and back up MIL. The Scapegoat is the other child (or every other child). Everything is their fault. Scapegoats suffer decades of all sorts of abuse.\nFM|Flying Monkey. A flying monkey is any person sent by MIL to gather/deliver information or generally wreak havoc. Just like the flying monkeys sent by the Wicked Witch of the West in The Wizard of Oz.\nJADE|[Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain](http://outofthefog.website/what-not-to-do-1/2015/12/3/jade-dont-justify-argue-defend-explain). Don't do any of them. Circular logic will be used to reinforce MIL's point of view. State your opinion or boundary clearly, but only once. She heard you.\nDARVO|Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. What a personality disordered MIL will do if you \"catch\" her in a lie or confront her with her wrongdoing. You end up the bad guy.\nFOO|Family Of Origin The people to whom you're related by blood.\nCBF|[Cat-Butt Face](http://i.imgur.com/ZfXDENa.jpg). A look of sour disapproval/pissiness mastered by old ladies in which their lips are pursed to resemble a cat's asshole.\nGrey Rock|A technique to discourage overbearing MIL from taking any interest in you. You are bland, uninteresting, you lack any sort of emotions for her to manipulate. You are the grey rock.\nFOG|Fear, Obligation, Guilt. The thick miasma of negativity that clouds your judgment in dealing with JustNOs.\nFLEAS|Not an acronym, just a metaphor for a normal person picking up some disordered personality traits by proximity to a JustNO. \"If you lie down with dogs, you'll get fleas.\"\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n####HELPFUL LINKS \u0026amp; RESOURCES\n* **[Our Official Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgrZl9D5H5o)**\n* **[Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/wiki/index)**\n* **[MILimination Tactics](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/wiki/milimination_tactics)**\n* **[How to Handle PMs from Trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/wiki/trolls)**\n* **[JNM Book List](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/wiki/books )**\n**CRISIS RESOURCES**\n* **[US](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org)**\n* **[UK](http://www.suicide.org/hotlines/international/united-kingdom-suicide-hotlines.html)**\n* **[Australia](https://www.lifeline.org.au)**\n* **[Canada](https://suicideprevention.ca/need-help/)**\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n####SISTER SUBREDDIT\n* **/r/JustNoSO** (For when your SO is actually the problem)\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n####WORDS OF WISDOM\n*It's easier to dump a mama's boy than to divorce a mama's boy, and both of those are easier than trying to [change a mama's boy.](http://youtu.be/FrLequ6dUdM)* ~/u/pastelegg\n*Abusers are the angler fish of humanity - they dangle a bright glowing ball of love in front of you so you don't see the teeth in the dark.* ~/u/silentgreen85\n*Next time they say, \"That's just how she is,\" reply, \"And this is how I am.

Illegal activity will be removed. The flairs exist for general categorization. If you have an issue with a product/service from an institution, contact them first to resolve before posting here.\n2) **Be helpful and respectful**\nBe helpful and respectful in your comments. No need to insult degrade or be offensive to others. \n3) **Avoid Surveys and Self-promotion**\nThis includes solicitation of referrals, posting your own blog, video channel or personal website, surveys to gather data, and recommendations for users to do business with you. Do not ask others about their own personal circumstances e.g. \"what would you do\" and/or \"what are you doing for x?\" We expect that users do not use this forum to build a brand, for financial gain, or to attempt to gain traffic or users. This also extends to PM'ing users because of comments they made on this subreddit.\n4) **All specific investment recommendations/requests will be removed** \nCRYPTO RECOMMENDATIONS WILL ALWAYS BE REMOVED. Broad funds/ETFs, or discussion of investment concepts would still generally be allowed. Pushing particular investments without mentioning risk tolerance, timeline, use for the funds, etc, will be removed. Inquiries around specific funds and/or investment strategies should be directed to r/CanadianInvestor.\n5) **IamAs/AMAs must be approved by mods**\nIf you'd like to host an \"I Am A/Ask Me Anything\" (IamA/AMA) thread, you must first [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPersonalFinanceCanada) for approval. We will evaluate if your topic is suitable for the subreddit and will set a date to avoid conflicts. Unapproved AMAs may be removed without notice at the moderator's discretion.\n6) **We expect that posts about crypto posted in this community PRIMARILY fit in with this community** Asking about Canada specific crypto taxation, rules, and other crypto topics would still be allowed, as the discussion resulting from it would be primarily Canada personal finance focused. CRYPTO RECOMMENDATIONS WILL ALWAYS BE REMOVED.\n####Posting guidelines\n**Include your province in your post!**\n**Include sources.**\nA good answer will be supported by relevant and reliable sources. Answers that link only to your personal blog or website are considered low-quality and may be removed at the moderators' discretion.\n**Have an in-depth answer.**\nUse a mix of context, explanation, and sources in your answer. Do not just post links to other sites as an answer. If you do believe a source fully answers a question then consider including a quote from the source. \n**Be inquisitive, and clear if you are unsure.**\nIf you have heard or read something which might be related to the question, and you want to check it, then make sure you ask it as a question. Do not post \"I'm not sure if this is true...\" or \"Someone will correct me if I'm wrong.\" If you're not actually answering the question, then make sure your comment looks like a question.\n####Wiki / Frequently asked questions\n[Reading list / recommended books](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/reading-list)\n[Step by step guide of what to prioritize / what to do with money](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/money-steps)\n[Frequently asked questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/faq)\n[**Wiki index with many more subjects**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/index)\n####Related subreddits\n/r/personalfinance\n/r/investing\n/r/CanTax\n/r/CanadianInvestor\n/r/FinancialIndependence\n/r/fican\n####Bot Triggers\nTrigger|Description\n---------|----------\n!StepsTrigger| Step by step list of what to do with money.\n!InvestingTrigger | Common questions that OP needs to answer in order to get proper advice about whether investing is appropriate for them.\n!CCTrigger | Common questions that OP needs to answer to get proper advice about recommending credit cards to them\n!MarginalTrigger | An example, using $15,000 of income and made up tax brackets, about how tax brackets work.

Posts advocating theft, or practices that in any way exploit or harm others (criminal or not) will be removed.\n4) This is not a place for politics, but rather a place to get advice on daily living and short-to-midterm financial planning. Political advocacy, debate, or grandstanding will be removed.\n5) Racism, sexism, classism/poor-shaming, or any other inherent bias will not be tolerated. Any comments/posts stating or implying that the reason that people are poor is because of personal decision making or that people in poverty \"deserve\" to be in poverty will be removed. \n6) No judgment on how people got to where they are at. Regardless of if someone was simply born into poverty, or earned it through drug use, criminal activity, gambling, having a lot of kids, working for LuLaRoe, etc. We're focused on the road forward, not the past.\n7) No gatekeeping. This sub is for anyone who self identifies as struggling financially or as financially insecure.\n8) Advice and comments must be in good faith. Anything that appears to be a scam, predatory, or downright dangerous will be removed. This includes most \"get rich quick\" schemes, including cryptocurrency which is too risky/volatile to be an investment for people with limited incomes.\n9) Links to websites outside of Reddit: The titles of these posts must have clear, accurate titles, misleading or vague titles will be removed. URL shorteners are not permitted. Referral links, or links to your own content (whether monetized or not) are permitted. You need to disclose if you have an affiliation with a site or service you are linking to. You must disclose referral links and provide a non-ref link as well, no exceptions! During the Holidays, referral links are not permitted as the sub becomes inundated with them.\n10) No soliciting, offering, or accepting public or private donations, loans, or crowdsourcing. All aid given must be in the form of information or advice. For financial donations please check out sites like r/donation r/charity and /r/randomactsofkindness \n11) Unsolicited advice must be generally respectful of people's right to determine their own values, free of assumptions and judgments, and in otherwise fitting with the rules, guidelines, and spirit of the sub. This includes posts flaired as \"Vent/Rant\" where any advice/judgment is prohibited as these are reserved as posts where users can simply express themselves. \n[Check out our Wiki for general useful information!](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/wiki/index)\nMuch of the financial advice online and on reddit is aimed at people who have varying degrees of disposable income, ability to invest, lots of free time, available transportation, no kids, a partner, access to credit, and beyond. This is a place for people who do not have a lot, nor ideal circumstances, to help each other get by and hopefully move up in the world. \nYou do not have to be absolutely destitute to be here. Whether you are a single parent only pulling 10k a year, or a single person trying to get past student loans at 28K, you are welcome here. The goal here is to help anyone who doesn't have a lot of breathing room get to a place where they have stability, comfort, contingency, and maybe even a little luxury. \n**Wiki**\nWe have a comprehensive sub wiki that can help with most poverty-related topics that you can access here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/wiki/index\nIf you have suggestions/recommendations for additional content/topics please let the mods know!\n**Guidelines**\n* At this time there are not a lot of restrictions on what kind of topics or items can be posted here, so as long as it relates to getting by when you don't have much feel free. Overtime we if/as the community develops we might start to rein in the scope this sub features.\n* Answer the questions asked and stay on topic. If someone asks for advice on how to 'buy' a cheap oil change, don't reply with \"Just do it yourself\". \n**Purpose**\n The sub is not for a single financial goal, but rather to help people with a range of goals. This may include but is not limited to: \n* Learning to live within one's means\n* Achieving a positive earning to expense ratio \n* Reducing debt and building savings \n* Moving to a better paying job\n* Cutting expenses \n* Spending smarter \n* Living a better life on the same budget \n* Working smarter, not harder \n* Planning for upcoming expenses, purchases, adventures \n* Finding qualifying benefits. \nThis is not a one-size-fits all venture, so please be respectful of what other people might be looking for. We are here to help each other achieve their needs and wants, not to judge their priorities. We get enough judgment from people who do not know our situation all the time, this sub will respect people's right to live their lives on their terms, not condemn them from afar. \n***\n**Useful subs:** \n***Finance:***\nr/personalfinance - a good place, especially once you have some money to play with.\nr/middleclassfinance - For when you don't want personal finance, but the next step up.\nr/FrugalPoverty - For those who prefer really frugal finance.\nr/Assistance - For those in need of help in more tangible ways.\nAnd /r/UniversalScammerList - In case you need to check names against scammers.\n***Tangible Help:*** \nr/Assistance - For those in need of help in more tangible ways.

Post your horror stories and show us those \"amazing\" job offers!\n___\n*Rules*:\n* Only text posts, screenshots, relevant articles, or archive links allowed. Do not link directly to a recruiting website (e.g., LinkedIn) or job ad.\n* Articles are allowed, but must be relevant. Articles meant to sell a company/product (\"addicles\") are spam and will be treated as such. This includes your \"helpful\" AI service. \n* Use link flair to tag your posts.\n* If your post is lengthy, try to highlight the most humorous areas. \n* Please try to *have* humorous areas. At least some dark humor or biting sarcasm.\n* *Please* be civil. Personal attacks against a person's skills, abilities, or anything else (recruiting-related or otherwise) will lead to disciplinary action. Basically, no namecalling, no insulting people, and no comments like \"no wonder you don't have a job\". (Note that being polite while namecalling, insulting, and so on is not the same as being civil)\n* As an addendum to that, opinions are totally fine, and it's acceptable to have an against the grain opinion. Our subreddit isn't about hate — it's about the annoying recruiting practices and the pain of getting a job. To that end, don't go out of your way to provoke arguments and start fights.\n* And as an addendum to *that*, note that using slurs (racist, homophobic, etc... I don't have to spell out every type of slur) or any sort of hate speech is a **one-strike ban.** Encouraging someone to kill themselves is also a one-strike ban, and I can't believe that I have to explicitly tell anyone that.\n* No posting of personal information. Please block out all identifying information including personal names, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, social media handles, and pictures. Company names may be posted. This is a Reddit-wide rule, not just one for our sub.\n* Minor typos or errors are not allowed as the entire point of a post. (e.g., $10/year instead of $10/hour)\n* It SHOULD go without saying, but no spam. Spam is defined as any attempt to pitch a product, service, or seek people for jobs (yes, this happens a lot). This includes posts advertising your new AI \"solution\" to job-hunting problems. Posting spam WILL get you immediately banned (**ONE STRIKE**), and a report will be sent to the Reddit Admins for possible account termination. If you want to advertise on Reddit, [buy ads](http://ads.reddit.com).\n* Be mindful of [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439). (Not posting personal information is also part of Reddiquette)\n* Being a dick towards the volunteer mods will get you voluntold off this subreddit. We're just trying to keep the community peaceful, don't make our lives difficult. If your initial reaction to being informed of the rules and asked to tone it down is to turn your rulebreaking up to 11, don't expect to stay here too long.

This subreddit is for things that are a little bit more wild, crazy, terrifying and incredible than the average. And for stuff that is generally insane! Fake content does not qualify as \"Insane content\". Think before submitting, would I find this post \"ThatsInsane\" if it would be someone else who posted it. Posts should be able to elicit a reaction of \"ThatsInsane\" from viewers.\n2. **No racism, bigotry, hate speech, inciting violence, etc**. This includes, but is not limited to, Racism, hate speech, bigotry, homophobia, islamophobia, and incivility will be removed and the poster will be banned. Do not in any way attempt to incite violence, hate based on identity directly or indirectly, you will get banned. We will be enforcing the [reddiquette](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette) and reddit's [official rules](https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules), so you need to obey them.\n3. **No pornography, overly gore, or disturbing material**. Examples of what can count as \"overly gore/disturbing material\" include stabbing, shooting, rape, serious injuries, children getting hurt, animal abuse, nasty things, and other content that contains scenes with a lot of blood..\n4. **Moderator Discretion**. Posts are at the discretion of the moderators. If we do not believe it fits the sub, or think it is spam, we will remove it.\n5. **Repost Guidelines**. This is only for reposts that have been posted to /r/ThatsInsane recently, is in top of all time or have been posted so often on reddit that the majority of users have seen this content. Quasi-reposts may also be removed per mod discretion.\n6. **Claims must be sourced in comments**. Posts with claims must have a linked and credible source that backs up the information. OP is the one responsible for this and it must be provided at time of posting. Also misleading information will be removed.\n7. **Use descriptive titles**. Non-descripted titles will be removed. Titles must describe the content, not your feelings or reactions to the content. \"insane\" or \"this is crazy\" is not a proper description.\n8. **No violence**. No violence, so no fights or injuries that **are not very very minor**. This obviously includes death posts, those are strictly forbidden.\n9. **No serious crimes**. No lootings, rape or other serious crimes. Don’t post something and *directly* or *indirectly* say ”this person commited this crime” or showing someone committing a **serious** crime.\n10. **Avoid rage-bait posts/comments**. Avoid rage-bait posts. Some posts may be allowed per moderator discretion. A rage-bait post can include, but is not limited to, protests that usually leads to a lot of inciting violence and hate based on identity in the comments, or islamophobia, homophobia etc, will be removed per this rule. Frequent offenders will be banned. The issue is that users exploit loopholes by posting rage-bait comments and posts to indirectly promote hate or incite violence, without actually doing it themselves.\n## Misc.\n * [Message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/ThatsInsane) if you have questions or concerns.

Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can *be your own bank*.\nIf you are new to Bitcoin, check out [We Use Coins](https://www.weusecoins.com/en/) and [Bitcoin.org](https://www.bitcoin.org/). You can also explore the [Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page):\n* **[Don't invest recklessly](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/)** \n* [Getting Started](https://bitcoin.org/en/getting-started) \n* [FAQ / Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq)\n* [Resources](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html)\n* [Common Myths](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths) \n* **[How to buy bitcoins worldwide](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/)** \n* [Bitcoin as a medium of exchange](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_as_a_medium_of_exchange)\n* [Will I earn money by mining bitcoin?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/18r5qc/will_i_earn_money_by_mining_an_answer_to_all/) \n* [Bitcoin as an investment](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_as_an_investment)\n* [Storing Bitcoins](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Storing_bitcoins)\n* [Well-Kept Gardens Die By Pacifism](http://lesswrong.com/lw/c1/wellkept_gardens_die_by_pacifism/)\n* [A Cypherpunk's Manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html)\n###Community guidelines\n* Do not use URL shortening services: always submit the real link.\n* Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.\n* News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.\n* Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. This subreddit is exclusive to Bitcoin.\n* Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.\n* No referral links in submissions.\n* No compilations of free Bitcoin sites.\n* Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 0.2 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion.\n* Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from *new* merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider [Reddit's self-serve advertising system](https://ads.reddit.com).\n* Do not post your Bitcoin address unless someone explicitly asks you to.\n* Be aware that X, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, etc. are full of impersonation.\n* Do not post about altcoins and do not post off-topic political spam.\n###Related communities\n^(Sorted roughly by decreasing popularity.)\n* **[Bitcoin Beginners](/r/bitcoinbeginners)**\n* [Local Bitcoin communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/wiki/local_communities)\n* [TheLightningNetwork](/r/TheLightningNetwork)\n* [BitcoinMarkets](/r/BitcoinMarkets)\n* [BitcoinMining](/r/bitcoinmining)\n* [BitcoinTaxes](/r/bitcointaxes) [[CryptoTax](/r/CryptoTax)]\n* [BitMarket](/r/BitMarket)\n* [Jobs4Bitcoin] (/r/Jobs4bitcoins)\n* [BitcoinDiscussion](/r/BitcoinDiscussion)\n* [BitcoinTechnology](/r/BitcoinTechnology)\n* [Best of Crypto] (/r/Best_of_Crypto)\n* [[More]] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/wiki/communities)\n^(Non-Bitcoin communities)\n* [Technology](/r/technology)\n* [Economics](/r/economics)\n* [Crypto](/r/crypto)\n* [Anarcho-Capitalism](/r/Anarcho_Capitalism)\n* [CryptoAnarchy](/r/cryptoanarchy)\n* [[More]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/wiki/communities)\n###Join us on IRC\n[web.libera.chat *#bitcoin*](irc://irc.libera.chat/bitcoin)\n###Other Bitcoin sites\n**[Bitcoin Forum](https://bitcointalk.org)** \n[Bitcoin Stack Exchange](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/) \n[Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/)\n###Download Bitcoin Core\n[**Bitcoin Core**](https://bitcoincore.org/en/blog/) is the [backbone of the Bitcoin network](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Full_node).

See 'The /r/trees Weekend' below.*\n ---\n1. **No Black Market Sourcing:** Do not offer, or ask for, recommendations on: where or how, on the black market, to acquire cannabis or anything derived from it (extracts, edibles, seeds, THC, CBD, etc.) freely exchanged or otherwise; or on how to smuggle, transport, ship, mail, or otherwise travel with cannabis or its derivatives. Do not make any posts involving meetups or other location-specific topics.\n2. **No personal attacks:** Be respectful to fellow posters – name-calling, rudeness, slurs, vulgarities towards other users, and trolling are not welcome here.\n3. **No minors:** /r/trees is strictly 18+ only, no exceptions (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/wiki/faq#wiki_why_is_.2Fr.2Ftrees_18.2B.3F) for more information on why). You might be interested in /r/saplings instead, where Redditors under 18 can ask questions about cannabis and its effects.\n4. **No advertising:** All forms of advertising and self-promotion are strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, posts promoting specific products or name brands, promoting YouTube channels or other forms of Social Media, and linking to online stores or other places designed to make money. Learn more about self-promotion on Reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Learn more about [spam](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-constitutes-spam-am-i-spammer) on Reddit.\n5. **No low-quality link posts outside of Saturday:** This includes memes, image macros, screenshots, simple trees references (such as pineapples and “420”), posts about broken glassware and spilled bowls, and all posts not directly about cannabis (besides the title). Those are allowed on “Slack-Post Saturday” every week, but you can make all those posts at /r/see during the week instead. See the [visual posting guide](http://imgur.com/a/1WL7J) showing types of disallowed posts.\n6. **No NSFW/Porn:** Do not post nudity or any sort of explicit porn. \n7. **No reposts:** For links, this involves any picture posted in the previous 6 months. For text posts, this involves asking any commonly asked questions on /r/trees (including questions about drug testing). For those, use the search bar and our [FAQ page](https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/wiki/faq).\n8. **No posts that harm the community:** Do not post pictures of tagging/vandalism, encourage driving while high (including pictures where you are obviously driving while high), post about sneaking weed past TSA, or make other posts harmful to the trees community.\n9. **No posts promoting political candidates:** Posts that endorse a political candidate, regardless of the connection to cannabis, are disallowed. \n10. **No posts involving a personal loss:** Those should be kept to the \"Monday Mourning\" thread each week.\nThe /r/trees mod team reserves the right to remove any other posts at our discretion. You can [contact the mod team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftrees) with any questions.\n---\n#### [](#h4-green) \n\u0026gt; **The /r/Trees Weekend**\n---\n ---\n####SLACK-POST SATURDAY\n ---\n* Every **Saturday**, *we relax our rules*. Artwork, GIFs, and image macros are all permitted for the day.\n* Not everything goes though: you still **can't** upload NSFW, ask for hookups/meetups, show disrespect towards other users or advertise anything *at all*. Read more [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2hhh5t/introducing_slack_post_saturday_bringing_back/).\n\u0026gt; \n---\n####SELF-POST SUNDAY\n ---\n* Every **Sunday**, *you can submit text posts only.*\n* This allows for a break from all of the link posts during the week, so the community can share their stories and talk with each other.

Failure to provide proper attribution\n- All builds/art/memes/etc. should be your own. Please make every effort to find the original author of a work, such as by reverse image searching. Reposting is acceptable, but you must provide proper attribution to the original artist, for instance by linking to the original or mentioning the user in a comment. If you cannot properly source a creation, you must still indicate that it is not your own. \n- Moderator discretion will be used to determine if there are any legitimately high-effort exceptions to this rule (i.e. Detailed post about things that might be included in a future patch)\n####7.

It only applies to items of real world monetary value.\n* Do not beg for a copy of the game.\n* Do not offer to trade for a copy of the game.\n* Do not bait people into asking for a copy of the game (e.g. saying that you have an extra copy of the game).\n* Giveaways are allowed but must follow the rules defined [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Terraria/wiki/rules#wiki_7.__no_begging.2C_trading.2C_or_baiting_for_copies_of_the_game.)\n####8. No low quality/effort submissions\n- No low quality/effort submissions. This means a post with one sentence in the body is not acceptable.

No piracy links or requests\n- Discussion of piracy is allowed, however encouraging and giving information on how to pirate the game will not be tolerated.\n- Anyone who provides links to pirated copies of the game will be banned immediately, without warning.\n* Asking for support with a pirated copy of the game (including multiplayer, getting updates, etc.) is also strictly not allowed.\n####12.

It is a sex-positive community and a safe space for people of all genders and orientations which demands respectful conduct in all exchanges. There is **ZERO TOLERANCE FOR CREEPY/HARASSING BEHAVIOR here** — in posts, comments, messages, or any other contributions. No exceptions.\n**[Rules, Guidelines, Block Unwanted DMs Guide, Other Misc.](https://old.reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/rules)**\n**[Wondering why we don't allow certain topics?](https://old.reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/rules/why_dont_we_allow/)**\n \n---------------------------------------\nThis is a large community dedicated to an extremely popular topic. If you wish to participate, it is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with our rules of conduct **BEFORE** you participate here. Failure to do so will result in your removal from the community. \n**PLEASE READ** the [FAQ](https://reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/index) with the most asked and answered questions - **BEFORE POSTING!!** Posts that do not follow the posting guidelines in the FAQ will be automatically removed.\n--------------------------------------\n**THE /R/SEX RULES**\n**1) ENGAGE CONSTRUCTIVELY AT ALL TIMES.** \nThis means ensuring that ALL of your contributions here are constructive, on-topic, mature, sex-positive, civil and respectful. Disrespectful conduct will see you banned from the community on the spot. Hitting on other people, asking for pictures (joking or not), making any sort of sexist comment or insult, body shaming, or trolling of any sort will result in your immediate ban.\n**2) DON’T SKIP THE FAQ OR THE FORUM RULES.** \nWe’re serious about this. Dozens of posts get removed every day because they’re covered in the FAQ or violate the forum rules.\n**3) DON'T OVERLOOK PAST POSTS.** \nWe’re serious about this, too. Many questions may be new to you, but are very common in our community. Before you submit a post on a common topic, search the forum.\n**4) ALL CONTRIBUTIONS MUST BE SEX POSITIVE.** \nWe demand that consenting adults be free to express their sexuality as they see fit. Kink shaming, slut shaming, and similar conduct will not be tolerated. Links or references to sex negative communities or websites (No Fap, Porn Free, etc) will not be tolerated. Attacks on the lifestyle of other consenting adults will not be tolerated.\n**5) POSTS SEEK ADVICE, COMMENTS PROVIDE IT.** \nThe main forum is focused primarily on posts seeking specific actionable advice for distinctive personal situations. Giving advice should primarily be done in the comments. General discussions are often allowed, so long as they adhere to the group rules and restricted content guidelines. If you want to make an exception, please request approval from moderators.\n**6) DO NOT TROLL OR ENGAGE WITH TROLLS HERE.** \nDon’t try to challenge, question, tease, fight, or outwit trolls here. Instead, use the Report button to alert moderators, who will review every single reported item. Trolling of any sort merits an immediate permaban.\n**7) ALL DISCUSSION MUST BE DIRECTED INTO THE PUBLIC FORUM.** Do not seek private conversations here, via Private Message or any other method. And do not seek to draw attention or clicks to an outside site of any type (unless you have received prior moderator approval, such as for academic research projects). Every comment here must be a clear attempt to engage with an ongoing public discussion in the forum. Violations of this rule will result in permanent bans without notice.\nFor anyone trying to avoid unwanted DM/chat requests, [here's how to change your settings](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/s/5u3SvkUALf).\n**8) RESTRICTED CONTENT** \nThis sub is generally only for seeking advice, education, or discussion about sex and sexuality. We restrict or forbid many types of content here.\nFor expanded definitions of these, please see the full /r/sex rules post.\n---------------------------------------\n**EXAMPLES OF CONTENT RESTRICTED IN /R/SEX:**\n**1) PROMOTIONAL POSTS.** \nThis means any post containing any kind of promotional element, especially one which seeks to lure traffic to another site or promote a product. Links to specific product descriptions are permitted if they’re PRECISELY on-topic in the context of the post, AND the post itself is clearly seeking advice in good faith. If you're trying to sell something, conduct market research, etc - these posts will get you banned. Linking to sex-positive blogs or podcasts is allowed, provided you make an effort to start a conversation here about the topic and use the link as supporting material.\n**2) LINK POSTS.** \nLinked material must be sex positive and precisely on-topic to stay up here, and needs to be introduced with a workable framework for discussion. Please see the posted [Link Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/linkpolicy) **BEFORE** you post links! Bare links to youtube, images, blogs, podcasts, etc are prohibited.\n**3) ACHIEVEMENT POSTS.** \nThese include appreciation, humblebrags, “I just had to share,” “I just want to say,” etc. These belong in the Weekly Sexual Achievement Thread, not in the main forum. Posts which are JUST sex stories belong somewhere else entirely — like r/sexstories or a similar forum. \n**4) LOW EFFORT MATERIAL.** \n“Does anyone else...?”, “Is [X] normal/weird?”, “Is [y] wrong/bad/okay?”, and so forth. Human sexuality is incredibly varied; yes, someone else likes what you like, and labels like \"normal\" or \"weird\" are meaningless - and in a sex positive community, we do not allow any moral judgments against sex acts or behaviors that are consensual. Title-only posts, posts with no effort at an actual conversation will be removed and may get you banned. Comments that consist of nothing but memes, \"this\", \"lol\" and such are highly disfavored. If comments do not further the discussion, they may be removed; a pattern of these may result in your ban.\n \n**5) SEEKING FAP MATERIAL.** \nDo not ask for sex stories, do not ask for the hottest/strangest/most unusual/etc encounter someone ever had. Do not ask for lists of other people's kinks. \n**6) PORNOGRAPHY, EROTICA, OR PERSONALS.** \nYou may not post or link pornography or erotica here. You may not share pictures of your genitals here - even if you are seeking medical advice (if you need to post a picture, you need to be going to a doctor). You may not recruit sex partners here, look for dirty chat, ask for someone to private message you, etc.\n**7) DISRESPECTFUL CONTENT.** \nPersonal attacks, insults, name calling, or disrespect of any sort are not allowed here. Sexism, racism, or any type of hate speech will result in your immediate ban. This is a community for **ALL GENDERS** - refusing to acknowledge a trans individual's gender flies in the face of this, and will result in your ban. \n**8) OPINION SEEKING, POLLS, VALUE JUDGEMENTS, OR VALIDATION POSTS.** \nThis forum is not for simply collecting opinions - \"do you think [X] is hot?\", \"Women, do you like [Y]?\", \"What is your favorite sex position?\" and so forth. This is not a forum to discuss your penis size, breast size, labia size, ask about other body image issues, or ask for feedback on your photos. See the /r/sex FAQ for help regarding body image issues. Do not post your pictures and ask people to rate or critique you. Do not ask if given consensual sexual interests are good/bad/okay/wrong, etc.\n**9) ACADEMIC SURVEYS.** \nThese require prior moderator approval. Moderators will review the question formats and will review the documentation of institutional ethical oversight (please provide). Non-academic surveys are seldom allowed. Please contact the moderators BEFORE you post a survey or study. \n**10) GENERAL RANTS, ESSAYS, EDITORIALS, VENTS, CONFESSIONS, PSAS, AND AMAS.** \nThese don’t belong in the main forum unless you have obtained prior moderator approval. Save them for story-based forums. Or Tumblr.\n**11) FREQUENT/FAMILIAR TOPICS.** \nThese are addressed in either the FAQ, past posts, or both. In case you are confused, this means that we **do not do penis size posts here,** nor can we tell if you or your partner are pregnant. \n**12) VAGUE TITLE/TOPIC.** \nIf a moderator can’t identify your issue or the type of advice you’re seeking, your post will be subject to removal. Titles should be at least several words long and adequately express what your post is about.\n**13) NONCONSENSUAL OR ILLEGAL CONTENT.** \n/r/sex is for the discussion of consensual sex among adults. We do not permit posts that advocate pedophilia, bestiality, rape, or incest here under any circumstances, nor do we allow these topics at all in most instances. Note that BDSM and CNC (consensual nonconsent) are perfectly valid topics in /r/sex.\n**14) OTHER OFF TOPIC ISSUES.** \nThis is not the place to discuss politics or religion, to seek dating advice, to ask for how to pick up women, to rant about how you have never had sex. Posts that appear to be dedicated to stirring up arguments - particularly about hot button topics like circumcision, the evils of pornography and/or masturbation, and other toxic subjects - will be removed and will result in swift bans.\nFor a complete list of restricted content, see the [rules sticky](https://reddit.com/r/sex/comments/14n6p9j/the_rsex_rules_and_guidelines_please_read_before/).\n***\n**Other Relevant Sub-Reddits:**\n• [BDSM Community](/r/BDSMcommunity)\n• [DeadBedrooms](/r/DeadBedrooms)\n• [Dirty Pen Pals](/r/dirtypenpals)\n• [Gone Wild](/r/gonewild)\n• [Ladyboners Gone Wild](/r/ladybonersgw)\n• [LGBT Sex](/r/lgbtsex)\n• [LGBT](http://reddit.com/r/lgbt)\n• [Normal Nudes](http://www.reddit.com/r/normalnudes)\n• [One Y Chromosome](/r/OneY)\n• [Polyamory](/r/polyamory)\n• [Redditor for Redditor (Personals)](/r/r4r)\n• [Relationships](/r/relationships)\n• [Sex Stories](/r/gonewildstories)\n• [Sex Toys](/r/SexToys)\n• [Swingers](/r/swingers)\n• [Transgender](/r/transgender)\n• [Two X Chromosomes](/r/TwoXChromosomes)"},{"display_name":"MMA","description":"\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;######Welcome to rMMA.

Keep the discussion related to Windows 10**\nPosts completely unrelated to Windows 10 will be removed. Just because something is compatible with Windows, doesn't mean this is the subreddit for it. Derailing conversations and threads is not allowed.\n* **2. Flair posts correctly**\nWe are not extremely strict with what flair you pick, but if it's very wrong we will change it. If we select another flair, don't put the original one back. Not sure what flair to use? Read [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_2._flair_posts_correctly) to help you decide.\n* **3. Do not distribute malicious programs**\nDo not purposely distribute viruses or other harmful programs or apps. Advising the use of pirated software (including piracy, activation tools, and bypasses to enable paid features) is prohibited. This also includes \"grey market\" and other activation keys from unauthorized resellers.\n* **4. Do not post Blogspam links or URL shorteners**\nBlogspam, URL shorteners, mobile links, and referral and affiliate links are not allowed. Post the full desktop link for articles and news.\n* **5. Be civil and do not troll others**\nPersonal attacks, bigotry, fighting words, inappropriate behavior and comments that insult or demean a specific user or group of users are not allowed. Posts or comments containing or seeking any identifying personal information are also prohibited. Do not engage in blatant trolling or flaming.\n* **6. Do not advertise a 3^rd party software without permission**\nIf you want to promote an app or website, you must [send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Windows10) to request permission. Include as much relevant information as you can in both the modmail and the post. This is not a marketplace subreddit, selling anything is prohibited.\n* **7. Do not promote pirated content or grey market keys**\nDo not post pirated content or promote it in any way. Encouraging or hinting at the use of sellers of grey market keys is not allowed.\nWindows LTSC (or LTSB) discussions are fine and welcome here; but it's hard to get it legally outside a corporate network.\nPromoting Windows LTSC (or LTSB) to home users or escalating the discussion to piracy is not allowed.\n* **8. Titles must be relevant to the post**\nIrrelevant, sensationalized, or vague titles that have the pure intent of misleading or dramatizing a topic are not allowed. The relevancy of submissions' titles will be judged at the moderator's discretion.\n* **9. Do not submit reposts, low-effort posts or rants**\nReposts are not allowed. All posts and answers that can easily be found by searching this subreddit or by using a search engine will be removed at the moderators' discretion. Although we encourage healthy discussions, rants and low-effort posts that do not contribute positively to the subreddit are not allowed.\n* **10. Only post memes on Mondays. No tech support anytime**\nMemes and other humor posts are only allowed on Mondays (UTC timezone) and they will be removed any other day of the week.\nNot Monday yet?

Skrócony regulamin:\n#Zasady platformy Reddit\n###**§ 1. Mowa nienawiści**\n* Nie zamieszczaj treści podżegających, wspierających lub usprawiedliwiających nienawiść lub pogardę wobec grup zmarginalizowanych lub podatnych na atak. Grupy te mogą być oparte na kolorze skóry, wyznaniu religijnym lub jego braku, pochodzeniu narodowym lub etnicznym, statusie imigracyjnym, płci, tożsamości płciowej, orientacji seksualnej, zaburzeniu lub chorobie psychicznej, ciąży lub niepełnosprawności. Należą do nich również ofiary przemocy, wypadków i ich rodziny.\n###**§ 2. Aprobata przemocy wobec ludzi i zwierząt**\n* Groźby, nawoływanie oraz aprobowanie przemocy, krzywdy fizycznej lub śmierci ludzi i zwierząt są zakazane. Wyjątkiem od tej zasady jest obrona przed aktami przemocy bez nadmiernej eskalacji. Zabronione jest negowanie medycznego konsensusu na temat szczepień i koronawirusa oraz promowanie homeopatii i innych niesprawdzonych naukowo sposobów leczenia.\n###**§ 3. Zbrodnie wojenne i totalitaryzm**\n* Aprobata ideologii totalitarnych, nazizmu, faszyzmu, komunizmu, aktów terrorystycznych, zbrojnych napaści na inne kraje oraz negowanie ludobójstw jest zakazane.\n###**§ 4. Udostępnianie danych osobowych**\n* Nie zamieszczaj danych osobowych. Dotyczy to przede wszystkim prywatnych numerów telefonu i adresów oraz imion i nazwisk osób niepublicznych, nawet jeśli są one publicznie dostępne. Nagonka z użyciem danych osobowych jest zabroniona.\n###**§ 5. Wulgarne treści**\n* Nie zamieszczaj ofert towarzyskich z podtekstem seksualnym, aktów, treści obrzydliwych, pornograficznych, sugestywnych oraz seksualizujących osoby nieletnie. Pozostałe treści nieodpowiednie dla nieletnich i przeglądania w pracy oznaczaj jako NSFW. Dopuszczamy wulgaryzmy, o ile nie stanowią zamiennika dla interpunkcji.\n###**§ 6. Inne zasady reddita**\n* Zakaz obejmuje brygadowanie, stawianie innych subredditów w złym świetle, manipulowanie głosami, unikanie banów poprzez zakładanie nowych kont, wspominanie subredditów z czarnej listy oraz banów otrzymanych na innych subredditach, spamowanie, nadużywanie funkcji zgłaszania treści, podszywanie się z zamiarem wprowadzenia w błąd, naruszanie prawa ochrony własności intelektualnej oraz tworzenie treści nacechowanych politycznie w trakcie trwania ciszy wyborczej.\n# Zasady /r/Polska\n###**§ 7. Ataki osobiste na innych użytkowników**\n* Na subreddicie zabronione są: nękanie, agresja słowna, inwektywy, chamstwo i prowadzenie nagonki wymierzone w innych użytkowników subreddita oraz pojedynczych użytkowników reddita.\n###**§ 8. Ograniczenie promocji**\n* Treści mające na celu pozyskanie bezpośrednich korzyści finansowych takie jak ofery pracy, sprzedaży czy zrzutki są zabronione. Treści mające na celu otrzymanie głosów do ankiet naukowych, zwiększenie popularności na innych platformach lub pozyskanie pośrednich korzyści finansowych z reklam są dozwolone, jeżeli nie przekraczają 10% aktywności użytkownika na /r/Polska.\n###**§ 9. Po polsku lub o Polsce**\n* Zamieszczane treści muszą być po polsku lub odnosić się do Polski. Zasada dotyczy zamieszczonej treści niezależnie od nadanego tytułu.\n###**§ 10. Tytułowanie tytułów**\n* Zmiana tytułów wątków publicystycznych oraz filmowych jest wymagana dla tytułów celowo wprowadzających w błąd, nadmiernie sensacyjnych, o niejasnym brzmieniu oraz wskazana w celu uzyskania bardziej deskryptywnego opisu. W pozostałych wypadkach tytuł musi być identyczny z tytułem artykułu lub filmu. Nie zamieszczaj subiektywnych opinii w treści takiego wątku. Zrzuty ekranu z tytułem lub fragmentem artykułu lub filmu muszą być udostępniane w formie linku do tego artykułu lub filmu.\n###**§ 11. Dublowanie tematów**\n* Nie zamieszczaj dubli - wątków nieoryginalnych lub niezawierających nowych istotnych informacji. Wątek może zostać usunięty jako dubel, jeśli niedługo po jego opublikowaniu pojawi się nowy wątek z trafniejszym tytułem lub większą ilością cennych informacji lub komentarzy. Wątki tekstowe takie jak pytania, dyskusje i ankiety mogą powtarzać się raz na tydzień. Wątki upamiętniające rocznice znaczących wydarzeń mogą się powtarzać raz na rok w te rocznice.\n###**§ 12. Artykuły wymagające subskrypcji**\n* Nie zamieszczaj wątków linkujących do artykułów wymagających subskrypcji. Strony z ograniczoną liczbą bezpłatnych wyświetleń są dopuszczalne.\n###**§ 13. Weryfikacja informacji**\n* Nie publikuj treści zawierających nieprawdziwe informacje. Linkowane serwisy informacyjne muszą zawierać kontakt do redakcji zawierający imiona i nazwiska redaktorów. Źródła z udokumentowaną historią dezinformacji mogą trafić na czarną listę. Wątki przedstawiające infografiki, statystyki, wykresy lub tabele danych muszą zawierać źródło danych bezpośrednio w wątku lub komentarzu.\n###**§ 14. Ograniczenie dziennej liczby wątków**\n* Nie zamieszczaj więcej niż 5 wątków w przeciągu 24 godzin.\n###**§ 15. Kontrola jakości**\n* Wątki niekompletne, nieczytelne, niezrozumiałe, nieodnoszące się do bieżących wydarzeń, nieprowadzące do wartościowej dyskusji, nieodbiegające konwencją od wielokrotnie już opublikowanych wątków lub o niskiej jakości załączonych materiałów mogą zostać usunięte.\n#Wydarzenia\nLista dotychczasowych **wymian** kulturalnych, AMA i innych cykli tematycznych znajduje się [tutaj](https://www.reddit.com/r/Polska/wiki/).\n#Inne polskie subreddity\nPełna lista polskich aktywnych subredditów znajduje się [tutaj](https://www.reddit.com/r/Polska/wiki/subreddity).\n#Sąsiedzi ♥\n* 🇪🇺 **[Europa](/r/europe)**\n* 🇧🇾 [Białoruś](/r/belarus)\n* 🇨🇿 [Czechy](/r/czech)\n* 🇱🇹 [Litwa](/r/lithuania)\n* 🇩🇪 [Niemcy](/r/de) + [Germany](/r/germany)\n* 🇸🇰 [Słowacja](/r/slovakia)\n* 🇺🇦 [Ukraina](/r/ukraina) + [Ukraine](/r/ukraine/)\n* [inni](https://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/ejgwj/list_of_european_subreddits/)"},{"display_name":"Switch","description":"Nintendo Switch subreddit!

Do not use any derogatory terms or hate-speech, regardless if it is a joke or not.\n * We also enforce the site wide content policy: https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy\n* **2)** No buying, selling or begging\n * Because this is not a marketplace subreddit, we do not have the capacity to keep users safe from being scammed during trades. For that reason, we do not allow posts regarding buying or selling. You are welcome to ask for an appraisal, but if your post appears to be soliciting buyers from the subreddit it will be removed.\n * We also do not allow posts that are asking for or begging for free games, eshop codes, spots on a family plan or game sharing.\n* **3)** Tag your spoilers, and do not include spoilers in titles.\n * If your post contains a spoiler for any game or media, please tag it using the spoiler tags: ``\u0026gt;!like this!\u0026lt;``. Make sure there are no spaces inbetween the spoiler tags.\n * Additionally, please do not include spoilers in the title of your post, as these cannot be marked\n* **4)** No spam or excessive self-promotion\n * You're welcome to promote your content so long as you contribute to the subreddit in other ways. Some factors considered at mod discretion:\n * Is your content unique? \n * Example: Let's Play (not unique, low-effort) versus Video Essay (more unique, high effort)\n * Is your Reddit account primarily used to promote your content?

If you would like to see the full rules, feel free to check them out on the [Rules Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/wiki/rules).\n**1. Roll Calls** are used to find other users who are going on a particular cruise. The /r/Cruise mod team is currently troubleshooting our bot and automatic roll call threads are not being created. In the meantime, please consider using the [CruiseCritic Roll Call Forum](https://boards.cruisecritic.com/forum/20-roll-calls/). Individual roll call threads are not permitted and will be removed.\n**2. Spam** has a very broad definition on this sub, and we have strict spam policy explained in detail in the wiki. If you created content on a third party site, it probably falls under this policy, so please read it!\n**3. Check The Wiki** before you post. If your question is already answered in the wiki, we will remove your post.\n**4. Personal Photos** are permitted in limited quantities. Photos should be of high quality and of your ship or your destinations, not yourself.\n**5. Simple Questions** should be directed towards the stickied \"Simply Questions Thread.\" To help determine if your post is a \"simple\" question, see the Simple Questions Thread or the Rules Wiki.\n**6. Discussion of Illegal Activity** is permitted; however, such behavior is not endorsed by /r/Cruise. Use common sense.\n**7. Explicit sexual content** is not permitted on /r/Cruise. Posts discussing sexual topics are permitted *so long as the discussion is relevant to other cruisers.* Please ensure you tag any such content as \"NSFW\" before posting. This sub is not the place for explicit discussions or storytelling.\n**8. Political Discussion** is only allowed to the extent it is relevant to cruising. Harassment, threats, and political trolling are never allowed. COVID-related discussion and debate is allowed, but misinformation is not.\n**9. Special Flair** (e.g. cruise line employee flair, travel agent flair, etc.) are assigned at the discretion of the mod team. If you would like to receive special flair feel free to [contact us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FCruise) and we will see what we can work out.\n---\nOther places that might be of interest:\n- /r/VirginVoyages\n- /r/dcl\n- /r/travel\n- /r/travelpartners\n- [Cruise Critic](http://www.cruisecritic.com/)\n- [CruiseHabit](http://www.cruisehabit.com/)\n- [National Hurricane Center](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/)\n- [Royal Caribbean's Blog](https://www.royalcaribbeanblog.com/)"},{"display_name":"BabyBumps","description":" \n**All Bump Photos belong in our Stickied Daily Thread**\n**All Ultrasound/Announcement Photos belong in our Stickied Weekly Thread**\nAll link posts must include content from the OP in the form of a comment.

Be respectful to other members. Do not discriminate, abuse, or otherwise disrespect other members, groups, or minorities. \n1. No low-quality/effort posts (iPad in a box, memes, meta..). We feel like you know what low-quality/effort posts are. A moderator will have the final say on whether or not a post is low quality/effort or not. \n1. \"What Should I Buy\", simple TechSupport questions and Apps requests will only be allowed in the [What Should I Buy](http://reddit.com/r/ipad/about/sticky?num=2) and [Discussion \u0026amp; Tech-Support](http://reddit.com/r/ipad/about/sticky?num=1) threads, respectively.\n1. We expect links and self-posts to foster discussion, and to have substance. Simple photos of an iPad don't deserve their own post unless they showcase a third-party accessory, same goes for simple yes or no questions. \"Title-only\" posts aren't allowed either.\n1. Posts soliciting the purchase, sale or donation of iPads, Apple Store credits, or UDID registrations are better suited to Craigslist or other sites.\n1. Jailbreaking talk goes in /r/jailbreak, sideloading talk goes to /r/sideloaded.\n1. Any request to remove MDM or otherwise break into devices will be removed.\n1. Out-of-topic content or content that isn't directly related to iPads will be removed. No drama content, no meta posts. No content from unknown/unsafe sources. \n1. Self-Promotion is prohibited unless posted and presented as self-promotion, and only in the General Discussion Thread. Exceptions may be made and the final say goes to the moderators.\n*If you have any suggestions regarding subreddit or community improvements, you can message the moderators at any time.\nThank you for reporting spam and other rule-breaking content.*\n###Related subreddits\n* /r/Apple\n* /r/AppleHelp\n* /r/iPhone\n* /r/AppleWatch\n* /r/CarPlay\n* /r/AppHookup\n* /r/AppleTV\n* /r/iPadMusic\n* /r/iOSProgramming\n* /r/iOSGaming\n* /r/Notabilityapp"},{"display_name":"REBubble","description":"A place to freely discuss and investigate the current US housing bubble.

Attack the argument, not the person when replying to other users within the subreddit.\n**2. Absolutely no brigading of other Reddit communities.**\n* Crossposting \"case study\" posts/comments to discuss examples of bubble behavior, or any content relevant to REBubble from other communities is completely fine. Nearly anything goes when discussing these crossposts, as long as all comments stay within the /r/REBubble comment section of the crosspost. Do not use these links to engage with the source subreddit in any manner that would violate their rules or the Reddit content policy, and do not encourage any users to do the same.\n**3. No notifying \"case study\" crosspost OPs of their appearance on /r/REBubble.**\n* Reddit users are not notified when their posts are crossposted to another community. Do not attempt to notify these users in any way that their post/comment has been featured on /r/REBubble. This includes but is not limited to contacting the OP of the crosspost via PM, replying to one of their comments or posts to inform them of the /r/REBubble submission, or tagging their username anywhere within the subreddit.\n**4. No low effort submissions which serve only to troll or bait the REBubble community.**\n* Dissenting opinions from real estate bulls and bubble doubters are welcomed and even encouraged. We have no desire to forcefully create yet another echo chamber community on Reddit. Anecdotes, speculation, and data is welcome from all sides. That said, posts which are low effort and appear to be attempts to inflame or bait REBubble community members rather than generate an honest discussion will be removed at moderator discretion.\n**5. No politics.**\n* Politics and government policy inform economic activity within the residential housing market. However, politics and discussions involving the arguing for or against political ideologies including, but not limited to, liberalism, conservatism, Democratic, Republican, civil rights, nationalism, and globalism are strictly prohibited. The endorsement or opposition of any political party or politician is strictly prohibited.

Help rules**\nRepeated neglect can result in a ban. \n1. Consult the documentation first \n2. Search for your question before posting \n3. Concrete questions/issues only! Don't ask \"How to make X\" before doing research \n4. \"Can Godot be used to make this game?\" Yes. \n5. Don't post photos of your screen, screenshots are okay, direct code with formatting or a pastebin is best \n6. We recommend checking the official forum for solutions as well. Make sure to link between the platforms when you cross-post questions.\n**5. Promotion rules**\nYou are required to use the promotion flair whenever you want to showcase your game. Do NOT use the \"discussion\" flair. You may use \"fun \u0026amp; memes\" when applicable, but do so sparingly and tailor your post to match the category.\n**6. Discussion rules**\nThis flair is for constructive conversations, not for venting your frustrations. Should you have feedback for the engine development team directly, please open an issue or proposal on GitHub instead.

Stay on topic**\nThis is a subreddit about the Godot Engine. While related Game Development topics are not forbidden, please make sure to tailor them towards the Godot project. This means NO ART posts unless you are talking about the technical side of things - there are enough other outlets to post your pretty renders and concepts.\n**9. Getting started**\nReference this https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/index.html before asking for general advice/help.

This means you are required to credit assets according to the licenses you acquired them under. Some licenses permit sharing content without listing your sources, others do not.

Rules\nPlease familiarize yourself with the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/wiki/rules/) of our community before you post.\n**Rule #1**: Keep it friendly, be respectful and follow Reddiquette.\n\u0026gt; Keep it friendly, civil, respectful, and don’t be insulting on purpose. We’re here to celebrate gacha games, ask honest questions, and have constructive discussions.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; Any post or comment that is too hostile, toxic, insulting, or breaks [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) may be removed, whether it’s directed at an individual or at a group of people.\n**Rule #2**: New posts must be related to gacha gaming.\n\u0026gt; Our community’s topic is gacha gaming, but this will often include things that are indirectly related, such as relevant celebrity, tech, or financial news.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; The relation to gacha gaming must be immediately obvious. Threads that are both not directly related to gacha gaming and deemed likely to stray too far off topic may be removed at the Moderation Team's discretion.\n**Rule #3**: Don't post banned content.\n\u0026gt; Some content is disallowed within the subreddit, including:\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; * “Gacha Life” game content\n\u0026gt; * Threads/screenshots about mobile game ads\n\u0026gt; * Referral/Invite codes (allowed in release threads only)\n\u0026gt; * BST or give away of accounts/products\n\u0026gt; * Information breaking typical game TOS (ex. game exploits)\n\u0026gt; * Verifiable/intentional misinformation\n\u0026gt; * Game revenue/store ranking screenshots\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; Full List: [Click Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_3.3A_don.27t_post_banned_content.)\n**Rule #4**: Post in the right place.\n\u0026gt; Many game-specific topics are OK. However, non-notable news unfit for a general gacha community should instead be discussed in the megathread or posted to the game-specific subreddit.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; * Some commonly-shared content that is disallowed includes:\n\u0026gt; * Character trailers and new banner news (unless part of a collaboration)\n\u0026gt; * Regular patch notes and content updates (version trailers are allowed)\n\u0026gt; * Most common social posts and in-game announcements\n**Rule #5**: No low-effort posts.\n\u0026gt; Every submission must be able to hold water as a standalone post. This means that you are required to submit enough substance for others to discuss without relying on additional comments.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **Titles for single-game-related submissions must include the game's name for immediate clarity.**\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; If you're simply asking a question, that’s fine, but please use the pinned Megathread to do so. Common discussion topics are only allowed once every 30 days.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; Memes are allowed only on Saturday's.\n**Rule #6**: Label your post properly.\n\u0026gt; Please use the most relevant post flair from those available.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; When promoting unofficial content like streams, Discords, subreddits, YT videos, surveys, etc., **include [PROMO] at the beginning of your title.**\n\u0026gt; **[PROMO] posts are limited to once / 7 days per member/creator/channel to prevent spam.**\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; Links to official websites, streams, and channels do not require the [PROMO] tag, but do need an appropriate flair.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; Non-nudity NSFW content is allowed, but it must be appropriately tagged.\n**Rule #7**: Try, try again.\n\u0026gt; While posts are most often removed because they were shared in the wrong place, sometimes the content just needs to be amended or added to with an edit.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; Titles must be descriptive and include the individual game's name, if applicable.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; When sharing game news or information, please include a link to the source or content if not already included as part of the post type. Screenshots of articles are not allowed; these must be submitted as link posts or have their link provided in the post body.\n----\n###Join the team\nAre you based in the EU or Asia?

No low effort posts.** Share investment ideas and insights or ask thoughtful investing discussion questions. We are not a politics or general corporate news forum. We generally expect that your topic incites responses relating to investing. Any post that contains large amounts of Gen AI text is considered low-effort. \n**2. Do not make posts looking for advice about your personal situation.**\nIf your question likely has a \"right answer\", a beginner topic, you simply need help finding general investing information, or if it's asking for general input on what to do with your investments then post in the \"[Daily Advice and Discussion Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/about/sticky?num=1)\".\n**3. Keep discussions civil, informative and polite.**\nOff topic comments, attacks or insults will not be tolerated. We recognize that this forum will generate differences of opinion, or misunderstandings of facts, and therefore arguments are expected. However, personal attacks, insults, trolling, or accounts dedicated to getting under the skin of others is not allowed, and will be banned.\n**4. Strictly no (self-)promotion or solicitation threads.**\nViolating this rule results in an automatic permanent ban. Do not post your youtube, twitter, discord, app, tool, blog, referral code, event, survey, etc. We generally expect that people who come here are not using the forum to build a brand, generate clicks, or shill. Posts that are strictly self-interested or intended to \"build awareness\" are not acceptable.\n**5 General corporate news and political posts** must follow these [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/rules#wiki_5._general_corporate_news_and_political_posts_guidelines). Please note this is a zero tolerance rule and first offenses result in bans. \n**6. Effort: Posts must meet standards of effort.** Do not post just an article, highlight the parts of the article you find relevant or offer some commentary surrounding the article. \nAdditionally do not just make a self post to offer some simple thoughts. \"now is the time to buy\", \"here's my thoughts\", etc. belong as comments to existing posts. Making your own post devoid of in depth examination will likely result in it being removed. There is a 250 character requirement for posts. \n**7. Original Sourcing: articles posted must be from the original source on a best efforts basis.** This means if CNBC is reporting on something WSJ reported on we expect you to post the original article. If anyone is writing an article based on a Bank/investment group news release/white paper post the actual paper and not journalism surrounding it. \nProvide the link to the source article or paper. \nThis rule will be more strictly enforced based on how clickbaity an article is. \n**8. Good faith discussions and comments only.**\nResponding to questions in bad faith, [brigading](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/rules#wiki_brigading_policy), spreading misleading and false information, stock promotions from dedicated accounts are not permitted.

This includes buying, selling, trading, contests and giveaways, and begging.\n\u0026gt; Sharing your PlayStation-themed original content (images, art, videos, etc.) is allowed, but posts strictly asking for account following or purchases of your content is not allowed.\n#### 6. 50% MEDIA SELF-PROMOTION LIMIT\n\u0026gt; Sharing your own branded / channel-based multimedia content is allowed only if you have a post submission history where no more than 50% of your last 10 posts (across all subreddits) are also similar self-promotion. A submission history of at least 10 posts is also required.\n#### 7. No Impersonating Sony / SIE\n\u0026gt; Do not post claiming to be an employee of Sony or Sony Interactive Entertainment. If you wish to engage with this subreddit in an official manner on behalf of your company, please contact the Mod Team via Modmail.\n#### 8. No low-effort content or comments \n\u0026gt; Submissions must have enough substance to initiate a discussion or provide value to the community. Self-posts with only a title and very little or no text are not allowed. Comments must add meaningful value to a discussion (e.g. comments such as \"I really want a new PSP\", \"I wish this was on PS4\", or reaction GIFS will be removed). Before submitting or adding a comment ask yourself: \"Does this add significant information or merit to the discussion?\"\n#### 9. Weekly Discussion Thread\n\u0026gt; Any topics already covered in this Weekly Discussion Thread will be removed if posted separately at the moderators' discreation. This helps keep the subreddit organized and ensures everyone can participate in a central discussion. Please check here first before creating new posts about ongoing topics.\n#### 10. Weekly Support/Purchase Thread\n\u0026gt; All Tech Support and Purchase Recommendation questions should be posted in the dedicated Tech Support \u0026amp; Purchase Recommendations Megathread. Posts on these topics made separately will be removed at the moderators' discreation.\n#### 11. Always link to the original source whenever possible\n\u0026gt; If the original source is unavailable, you may link to an appropriate alternative. Avoid blogspam—websites that copy or embed content without adding value. However, alternatives with meaningful analysis may be allowed, but the original source should be prioritized. If a source redirects to another, link to the one with the most context. For example, if a tweet links to a developer's blog post, link directly to the blog post.\n#### 12. Submission Title Guidelines\n\u0026gt; Use the original title when possible. If unclear or too complex, modify it for clarity without sensationalism or editorializing. You may add relevant context like the author's name, spoilers, NSFW warnings, release dates, or platforms. Titles must be in English, civil, and concise. Avoid all-caps (unless in the original), inflammatory language, or phrases like \"This deserves attention.\" If more context is needed, consider a self-post.\n#### 13. No surveys or polls are allowed \n\u0026gt; Posts asking users to fill out surveys, forms, or participate in polls will be removed.\n###[Additional Rules Information.](https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/wiki/index)\n---\n#Other PS Subreddits:\n* [r/PS5](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/)\n* [r/PS4](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/)\n* [r/PS3](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/)\n* [r/ps2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ps2/)\n* [r/vita](https://www.reddit.com/r/vita/)\n* [r/PSVR](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSVR/)\n* [r/Trophies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trophies/)\n####Spoiler Guide\n\u0026gt; For **simple spoilers**, use the following formatting:\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **Spoiler** \u0026gt;!The La-Li-Lu-Le-Lo!?!\u0026lt;\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; It will look like this:\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **Spoiler** \u0026gt;!The La-Li-Lu-Le-Lo!?!\u0026lt;\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; To use **labeled spoilers**, you can put a prefix before the word spoiler to add context like the following example:\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **God of War Spoiler** \u0026gt;!BOY!!\u0026lt;\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; It will look like this:\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **God of War Spoiler** \u0026gt;!BOY!!\u0026lt;\n***\n#Game Subreddits:\nGames | Games\n:--- | :---\n[Astro Bot](/r/Astrobot)|[The Order 1886](/r/TheOrderGame)\n[Bloodborne](/r/Bloodborne)|[Persona 4 Golden](/r/Persona4Golden)\n[DarkCloud](/r/DarkCloud)|[Persona 5](/r/Persona5)\n[Days Gone](/r/DaysGone)|[Parappa the Rappa](/r/Parappa)\n[Demon's Souls](/r/demonssouls)|[PlayStation All-Stars](/r/psbattleroyale)\n[Deep Down](/r/DeepDown)|[PlayStation Home](/r/PlayStationHome)\n[Doki-Doki Universe](/r/dokidokiuniverse)|[Ragnarok Odyssey](/r/RagnarokOdyssey)\n[Dragon's Crown](/r/DragonsCrown)|[Ratchet \u0026amp; Clank](/r/RatchetAndClank)\n[DriveClub](/r/Driveclub)|[Resistance](/r/resistance)\n[Dust 514](/r/Dust514) ([clan](/r/subdreddit))|[Resogun](/r/Resogun)\n[Firewall: Zero Hour](/r/FireWallZeroHour)|[Shadow of the Beast](/r/ShadowoftheBeast)\n[Ghost of Tsushima](/r/ghostoftsushima)|[Shadow of the Colossus](/r/ShadowoftheColossus)\n[God of War](/r/GodOfWar)|[Sly Cooper](/r/Slycooper)\n[Gran Turismo](/r/GranTurismo)|[SOCOM: US Navy Seals](/r/socom)\n[Gravity Rush](/r/GravityRush)|[Soul Sacrifice](/r/soulsacrifice)\n[Horizon](/r/horizon)|[Sound Shapes](/r/soundshapes)\n[Helldivers](/r/Helldivers/) |\n[inFAMOUS](/r/infamous)|[Spider-Man](/r/SpidermanPS4)\n[Jak \u0026amp; Daxter](/r/jakanddaxter)|[Starhawk](/r/Starhawk)\n[Knack](/r/Knack)|[Team ICO](/r/TeamIco)\n[Killzone](/r/killzone) ([Mercenary](/r/KillzoneMercenary))|[The Tomorrow Children](/r/thetomorrowchildren/)\n[The Last Guardian](/r/thelastguardian)|[Twisted Metal](/r/TwistedMetal)\n[The Last of Us](/r/thelastofus) ([MP](/r/thelastofusfactions))|[Tearaway](/r/tearaway)\n[The Legend of Dragoon](/r/legendofdragoon)|[Uncharted](/r/uncharted)\n[LittleBigPlanet](/r/LittleBigPlanet)|[Until Dawn](/r/untildawn)\n[M.A.G.](/r/mag)|[White Knight Chronicles](/r/WhiteKnightChronicles)\n[MLB: The Show](/r/mlbtheshow)|[WiLD](/r/wildthegame)\n[Motorstorm](/r/allmotorstorm)|[WipEout](/r/WipeOut)\n#####**Multiplatform PS Subreddits**\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; - [Battlefield (PlayStation)](/r/PSBF)\n\u0026gt; - [Borderlands (PS3)](/r/borderlands_PS3)\n\u0026gt; - [Borderlands (Vita)](/r/borderlandsvita)\n\u0026gt; - [Diablo III (PS4)](/r/D3PS4)\n\u0026gt; - [EA Sports UFC (PS4)](/r/EAUFCPS4)\n\u0026gt; - [FIFA (PS4)](/r/FifaPS4)\n\u0026gt; - [Grand Theft Auto V (PS3)](/r/ps3gtav)\n\u0026gt; - [Minecraft (PlayStation)](/r/PSMinecraft)\n\u0026gt; - [NHL (PlayStation)](/r/NHL4PSN)\n\u0026gt; - [Trials Fusion (PS4)](/r/TrialsFusionPS4)\n#####**Other PS Subreddits**\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; * [PlayStation Solutions](/r/PlayStationSolutions) (Tech Help)\n\u0026gt; * [PS4 Clans](/r/ps4clans)\n\u0026gt; * [PS4 Custom Designs](/r/PS4Mods)\n\u0026gt; * [PS4 Tournaments](/r/PS4Tournaments)\n\u0026gt; * [Share Play](/r/PSNSharePlay)\n\u0026gt; * [PlayStation VR](/r/PlayStationVR) / [Project Morpheus](/r/ProjectMorpheus)\n[PlayStation Discord](https://discord.gg/ps)\n*Please note that this subreddit does not have an official Sony / SIE / PlayStation presence.

The term usually implies the following of an order in such a way that ignores the order or rules's intent but follows its letter. It is usually done to injure or harm while maintaining a sense of legitimacy.\nWhile writing your stories, please make sure to explain why the result is something you'd like to happen. If you can't figure out why you're so happy about the situation, just make sure it's clear that you don't like the person, company, or group that suffered as a result of your flawless victory. Trust me, stories that explain that their boss is a dick or the snotty mom from down the street had it coming are just much more enjoyable to read.\nRules:\n1. All posts must be a story that must contain some form of malicious compliance. Malicious is interpreted broadly, but posts where people do not comply with rules will be removed. Update posts must link to the previous post on this subreddit and are subject to moderator approval.\n2. No stories involving the following banned elements: Death of anyone, Historical Figures, Fantasy Creatures, Schools (school employees and university students are okay), Complier involuntary bodily functions, or Malicious Compliance with subreddit rules. Also do not thank or reference Youtubers/Influencers. Please ask the moderators if you’re unsure.\n3. Don't question the validity of a story. It's much more fun if we give people the benefit of the doubt.\n4. Original content only. If it’s not yours then do not post it and do not comment it. You may link to where the owner posted it if you can find it. You do not own the words of other people. You do not own random photos you found online. You do not own Calvin \u0026amp; Hobbes.\n5. Comments must forward the discussion. A comment that only insults without prompting further discussion will be removed. Those requesting a user be banned who breaks no rules may be banned themselves at mod discretion.\n6. It must be clear that whoever is complying is doing so intentionally. Animals and malfunctioning computers are not allowed. Stories involving children must be from the child’s perspective (your story or a story someone told you from their childhood about something they did) or an adult maliciously complying in a way that involves a child (such as a parent using a loophole to skirt a school rule).\n7. Include the fallout. Wait until expected fallout has occurred before sharing. You must also have maliciously complied, not just thought about how you want to. If you’re expecting to have an update, wait until that later date. If additional fallout occurs later, you may be able to update, but it should be a surprise.\n8. No Acronyms As Names. Don't make up acronyms for your post. Don't use acronyms from another subreddit. Generally known acronyms are fine. Use industry terms if you like, but explain what they mean.\n**We may take any action, including banning, for the first infraction of any rule!**\nOther subreddits you might enjoy:\nr/IDontWorkHereLady\nr/deliciouscompliance\nr/adorablecompliance\nr/PCIYFTY\nr/wewontcallyou"},{"display_name":"truegaming","description":"####[Join our Discord!](https://discord.gg/truegaming)\n# Rules\n###**1.

However, remember that you are taking advice from people on the internet. /r/skiing mods do take the time to require proof for all user flairs that involve any expertise and skill; however, with questions that could lead to an injury, getting shop advice is always the wisest choice.\n**Click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/skiing/about/rules) for more information.**\n#Related subreddits\n* [backcountry](http://www.reddit.com/r/Backcountry)\n* [cross-country](http://www.reddit.com/r/xcountryskiing)\n* [snowboarding](http://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding)\n* [action sports](http://www.reddit.com/r/Adrenaline)\n* [outdoors gear](http://www.reddit.com/r/outdoorsgear)\n* [ski jumping](http://www.reddit.com/r/skijumping)\n* [big mountain](http://www.reddit.com/r/BigMountain)\n* [ski bums](http://www.reddit.com/r/skibums)\n* [biathlon](http://www.reddit.com/r/biathlon)\n* [SNOW the game](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowthegame)\n* [telemark](https://www.reddit.com/r/telemark)\n* [ski buddies](https://www.reddit.com/r/skibuddies)\n* [snowshoeing](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowshoeing/)\n* [ski racing](https://www.reddit.com/r/skiracing)\n* [ski gear](https://www.reddit.com/r/skigear)\n* [Urban skiing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Urban_Skiing)\n**Local subreddits**\n* [big sky](http://www.reddit.com/r/bigsky/)\n* [colorado](http://www.reddit.com/r/cosnow)\n* [new england](http://www.reddit.com/r/newenglandskiing)\n* [vail](http://www.reddit.com/r/vail)\n* [tahoe](http://www.reddit.com/r/tahoe)\n* [breckenridge](http://www.reddit.com/r/Breckenridge)\n* [summit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Summit)\n* [UT snow](http://www.reddit.com/r/UTsnow)\n* [australia snow](http://www.reddit.com/r/AustraliaSnow)\n* [anchorage](http://www.reddit.com/r/anchorage)\n* [ice coast](http://www.reddit.com/r/Icecoast) \n* [whistler](http://www.reddit.com/r/whistler)\n* [Pennsylvania](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkiPA )\n#Useful links\n* [National Ski AreasAssociation](http://www.nsaa.org/nsaa/home/)\n* [Carpool to the mountain!](http://www.skicarpool.org/)\n* [Circle Square Diamond (mountain art)](http://www.circlesquarediamond.com/)\n* [Honest Trail Maps](https://www.reddit.com/r/skiing/comments/9s4iq3/honest_trail_maps_update_2018/)\n* [/r/skiing Spotify Playlist](https://play.spotify.com/user/1214930135/playlist/2gU2BJouBI93S8eIWimbCj) **NEW**\n* [Ski tech AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/skiing/comments/zqi05/ski_season_is_right_around_the_corner_thought/)\n* [Moment skis](https://www.reddit.com/r/momentskis/)\n**Looking for New Gear?**\n* [REI (Alaska included in free shipping)](http://www.rei.com/)\n* [Evo](http://www.evo.com/)\n* [Level 9 Sports](http://www.levelninesports.com/)\n[We are night mode compatible.](#/RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible)\n######**Visit our Discord server!

This is earned by contributing thoughtful comments to others' discussions. This policy not only helps reduce spam but ensures that you understand the community's dynamics—what types of posts resonate, and what might be overlooked or poorly received.\nOur goal is to help your posts gain traction. Take some time to engage with the community and discover how we can best support you.\n2) **No Promotion** \nPosts and comments must NOT be made for the primary purpose of selling or promoting yourself, your company or any service.\nDropping URLs, asking users to DM you, check your profile, or comment for private resources will all lead to a permanent ban.\nIt is acceptable to cite your sources, however, there should not be an explicit solicitation, advertisement, or clear promotion for the intent of awareness.\n3) **No Personal Attacks** \nConstructive criticism of ideas, concepts, approaches, or plans is encouraged. Embracing reality, even when it is challenging, is a crucial aspect of business. However, personal attacks, hostility, or incitement to conflict are strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated in this community.\nIf you encounter threats or harassment, please report them immediately. Avoid engaging with users who are harassing you or others.\n4) **Links Allowed as Supporting Material ONLY** \nThis rule exists to foster meaningful discussion. If you wish to share links, they must be directly relevant, clearly described, and essential to the conversation. Your post should include sufficient context within Reddit to enable a productive dialogue.\n5) **No “How To Get Rich Quick” posts** \nThis community is NOT for quick money schemes. Entrepreneurship is often a challenging and demanding journey, requiring effort, hard work, grit, and determination. Posts asking how to make $X, without a specific or reasonable idea, will not be tolerated, as they do not contribute meaningfully to the discussions in this subreddit.\n6) **Avoid unprofessional communication** \nAs a professional subreddit, we expect all members to uphold a standard of reasonable decorum. Treat fellow entrepreneurs with the same respect you would show a colleague. While we don't have an HR department, that’s no excuse for aggressive, foul, or unprofessional behavior. NSFW topics are permitted, but they must be clearly labeled. When in doubt, label it.\nAI-generated content is not acceptable to be posted. If your posts or comments were generated with AI, you may face a permanent ban. \n7) **No free offerings threads** \nOur \"Thank You Thursday\" threads are designated for any promotions, offers, or discounts you wish to share with the community. Please refrain from posting free offerings outside of this weekly thread that is pinned to the top of the community. Any such posts made elsewhere will be removed.\n8) **Follow the [Rules of Reddit](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)** \nThey apply everywhere on Reddit. Also consider [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette/) The latter isn't mandatory but might be used in considering the intent of your post.\n9) **Unsolicited Opinions and Duplicate Thoughts** \nPosts in Entrepreneur should be unique. If a duplicate post can be found on one or more similar subreddits or on a blog, then it's not a good fit for this subreddit.\nPlease refrain from using this community as your personal blog. There is no need to share opinions or use this space as a diary for daydreams, thoughts, or subjective reflections.\n10) **No Investment Solicitation** \nPosts about specific investments, such as cryptocurrency, are not permitted. Please refrain from soliciting, promoting, or offering any form of investment advice. There are other subreddits better suited for those discussions.\n***\nFlair Filters| [Want More?](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FEntrepreneur)\n---|---\n[Case Study](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Case+Study%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all\u0026amp;feature=legacy_search)| [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27AMA%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all\u0026amp;feature=legacy_search)\n[Startup Help](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Startup+Help%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all\u0026amp;feature=legacy_search)| [Tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Tools%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all\u0026amp;feature=legacy_search)\n[How Do I?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27How+Do+I%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all\u0026amp;feature=legacy_search)| [Investor Wanted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Investor+Wanted%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all\u0026amp;feature=legacy_search)\n[Operations](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Operations%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all\u0026amp;feature=legacy_search)| [Other](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Other%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all\u0026amp;feature=legacy_search)\n[Internship Offers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Internship+Offers%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all\u0026amp;feature=legacy_search)| [Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Recommendations%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all\u0026amp;feature=legacy_search)\n[Best Practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Best+Practices%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all\u0026amp;feature=legacy_search)| [Young Entrepreneur](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Young+Entrepreneur%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all\u0026amp;feature=legacy_search)\n[How to Grow](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27How+to+Grow%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all\u0026amp;feature=legacy_search)| [Lessons Learned](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Lessons+Learned%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all\u0026amp;feature=legacy_search)\n[Feedback Please](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Feedback+Please%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all\u0026amp;feature=legacy_search)| [Ask Mods for Other Flair.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FEntrepreneur)\n***\n##Our Weekly Sticky Posts\n**NooB Monday** - For the most basic of questions \n**Marketplace Tuesday** - Post jobs or internships you're looking to fill or about services you can offer\n**Wantrepreneur Wednesday** - Looking to ask a question a bit beyond the super basic but don't need a whole thread?

Looking for Chiefs bars outside of KC? **[Read the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/KansasCityChiefs/wiki/) before posting!**\n| **RULES** |\n|:----------|\n|**BE RESPECTFUL to others**. Bigotry of any kind, trolling, raiding rival subs are all *instabans*.|\n|Do not spam your own website/blog or sell merch without prior mod approval. Selling tickets to games is not allowed.|\n|Reposts/low-effort/low-content/upvote posts are subject to removal. Simple questions or thoughts should go in the **daily/weekly threads**.|\n|Nobody cares about your fantasy team or what you did in Madden, don't make individual posts about it.|\n|Going to other NFL team subreddits and trolling will be met with a temporary ban or permanent ban, depending on the severity. Be civil.\n| **POSTING GUIDELINES** |\n|:----------|\n|(1) All news posts shall be a direct link from the source. They shall be sourced with author's name in brackets eg. \" [Name of Reporter] 'Title of post/article'\". Titles shall not be editorialized or misleading. All other posts should have clear and concise titles. |(2) Posts need to have some level of quality, and cannot be reposts. Text posts require at least 50 words in the body as a quality minimum; simple questions or often discussed topics should go in the daily discussion threads. If you have questions about Arrowhead tailgating/atmosphere, Chiefs bars outside of KC, etc., read the pinned wiki before posting.|\n|(3) Memes are allowed 24/7, however the moderators have the discretion to remove \"low effort\" memes. This could be low resolution memes, reposted memes, or for any other reason. If you believe your meme was not low effort and was removed, please contact the moderators. High Quality Gifs are an exception to this rule, due to them being high quality by default.\n|(4) \"Facebook\" type posts are only allowed as individual posts from Friday to Gametime. This includes pictures of merchandise, pictures of yourself in Chiefs gear, pictures of dogs in Chiefs gear, and things of that nature. During the week these are only allowed in the Daily Discussion posts.| \n|(5) \"X fan here\" posts are not allowed. If you want to say something to Chiefs fans, do so in post game threads or the daily discussion threads.|\n|(6) No unauthorized giveaways. As much as we all would love free tickets, it is impossible to verify the authenticity and follow-through of any transaction. If you have a compelling reason why your giveaway should be allowed, please reach out to the mods first for approval.| \n|(7) Do not spam your own website/blog or sell merch without prior mod approval. Selling tickets to games is not allowed. |\n|(8) There are many places on Reddit for political discussions. This subreddit isn't one of them. |\n|(9) Crossposts from other NFL team subreddits are not permitted. Crossposts from non-NFL subreddits are allowed. |\n|(10) Posts from Twitter/X should be submitted as a cropped screenshot with the [Author Name] in brackets and full and/or accurate headline/tweet that correctly reflects the content- i.e. [Adam Schefter] Patrick Mahomes has signed a new $500 million dollar contact. \nScreenshots should NOT be edited or doctored in any way and are subject to mod verification. Altered news screenshots or any actions taken to create intentional misinformation will be met with a permanent ban. Highlights and videos from Twitter/X should be submitted as direct uploads or posted from an alternative source such as YouTube.\n---\n[**OFFICIAL SUBREDDIT DISCORD**](https://discord.gg/ZDEdXsc)\n---\n###2025 PRESEASON\n|Date|Opponent|Result|Final Score|TV/Time|\n|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|\n|AUG ?|@ AZ|-|-|TBD|\n|AUG ?|@ SEA|-|-|TBD|\n|AUG 22|vs CHI|-|-|NBC 7:20pm\n###2025 REGULAR SEASON\n|Date|Opponent|Result|Final Score|TV/Time|\n|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|\n|SEP 5|@ LAC (in Brazil)|||YT 7:00pm\n|SEP 14|vs PHL|-|-|FOX 3:25pm\n|SEP 21|@ NYG|-|-|NBC 7:20pm\n|SEP 28|vs BAL|-|-|CBS 3:25pm\n|OCT 6|@ JAX|-|-|ABC 7:15pm\n|OCT 12|vs DET|-|-|NBC 7:20pm\n|OCT 19|vs FTR|-|-|CBS 12:00pm\n|OCT 28|vs WAS|-|-|ABC 7:15pm\n|NOV 2|@ BUF|-|-|CBS 3:25pm\n|NOV 9|BYE|-|-|\n|NOV 16|@ DEN|-|-|CBS 3:25pm\n|NOV 23|vs IND|-|-|CBS 12:00pm\n|NOV 27|@ DAL|-|-|FOX 3:30pm\n|DEC 7|vs HOU|-|-|NBC 7:20pm\n|DEC 14|vs LAC|-|-|CBS 12:00pm\n|DEC 21|@ TEN|-|-|CBS 12:00pm\n|DEC 25|vs DEN|-|-|AMZ 7:15pm\n|JAN ?|@ FTR|-|-|TBD\n###2025 POSTSEASON\n|Date|Opponent|Result|Final Score|TV/Time|\n|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|\n|JAN |vs |||\n|JAN |vs |||\n|FEB |vs |||\n###**AFC WEST**\n|Team|W-L|Div|Conf|PF|PA|Diff|\n|:----------:|:----------:|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|\n|KC|||||||\n|LAC|||||||\n|DEN|||||||\n|LV|||||||\nGet an r/kansascitychiefs community exclusive 80% discount to Seth Keysor's Chiefs in the North Newsletter [here](https://mnchiefsfan.substack.com/Chiefsreddit).\n|Related Subreddits|\n|:----------|\n| /r/NFL|\n| /r/FantasyFootball|\n| /r/CFB|\n| /r/AAFB|\n| /r/AFC|\n| /r/kansascity|\n| /r/kansascitybeer|\n| /r/KCRoyals|\n| /r/sportingkc|"},{"display_name":"writing","description":"#### Welcome. ####\n\u0026gt; Welcome to the home for writers. We talk about important matters for writers, news affecting writers, and the finer aspects of the writing craft.\n---\n**Weekly Daily Discussion Thread Schedule:**\nMonday: Writer’s Block and Motivation\nTuesday: Brainstorming\nWednesday: General Discussion\nThursday: Writer’s Block and Motivation\nFriday: Brainstorming\nSaturday: First Page Feedback\nSunday: Writing Tools, Software, and Hardware\n---\n#Upcoming AMA Posts\n- Clarion West Writers Workshop\n November 1, 10AM-2PM (Pacific)\n*Want to do an AMA? Please [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fwriting) to verify yourself before posting. Thank you!* \n---\n#Before posting, check out:\n## **[FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki/faq)**\n##[Our Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki)\n##[Related subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki/hub)\nHere's a general synopsis and explanation of /r/writing's community rules. Please keep these guidelines in mind for all of your posts and comments. The moderators do reserve the right to remove posts/comments that are deemed harmful without warning and ban users depending on the severity of the infraction.\n---\n##[Posting Guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki/rules)\n###1. Posting Work\nSamples of writing, whether for critique, self-promotion, or general sharing, may only be posted in the weekly self-promotion and critique thread. Requests for writing partners may also only be posted in the critique thread. Requests for school help should be posted in r/homeworkhelp, including posts about school essays or citations.\n---\n###2. Self-Promotion\nWe do not allow advertisements for your book, website, new subreddit, etc., or for you to do so on behalf of another company, outside of the self-promotion thread. This includes both posts and comments.\n---\n###3. Posts should be thoughtful and useful to a broad community of writers\nWe ask that users frame their posts so they are useful to multiple people. If your post invites answers that are specific to your work alone, it belongs in our brainstorming thread. “Low effort” posts (two lines of text, repetitive questions, etc.) will be removed. Posts focused on personal sharing may only be posted in the general discussion thread.\n---\n###4. Submission Calls Requirements/AMAs\nCalls for submissions (including posts about general writing work) must include 1) payment information; 2) submission deadlines; 3) rights requested; 4) any other relevant information. Directing to a website to answer these questions is not allowed. Please limit yourself to one post per publishing cycle. AMAs may not be posted without mod approval. We prefer subjects be part of the wider writing industry or have done something more than publish a book. Please message modmail for AMA requests.\n---\n###5. Civility\nTreat other people with decency and respect. We encourage healthy debate and discussion, but we will remove antagonistic, caustic, or otherwise belligerent posts. We moderate on tone rather than language.\nRacist, homophobic/transphobic, misogynistic, ableist, and other categories of hate speech (including against “acceptable targets”) will be removed. Please report any instances of offensive talk, and the mods will deal with them. Internet vigilantism and doxxing will not be tolerated.\n---\n###6.

Particularly, read our [Starter's Guide](/r/LearnJapanese/wiki/index/startersguide) and [FAQ](/r/LearnJapanese/wiki/index/faq/).\n### b) Please find and take a look at the [Daily Thread](/r/LearnJapanese/search/?q=%22daily%20thread%22\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all). **This includes reading the top comment by AutoModerator.** The thread is pinned at the top of the front page.\n### c) Locate also our rotating Weekly Thread. Again, the thread is stickied at the top of the front page.\n### d) Accounts with low \"[subreddit karma](/r/LearnJapanese/wiki/subredditrules#wiki_what_is_.22karma.22.3F)\" may only comment on other people's threads. They cannot post their own. If you're new here, use the Daily Thread.\n## Rules\n### 1) Questions addressed in the wiki will be removed. Repeat questions may also be removed. Use the search to look for old threads.\n### 2) Use the appropriate sticky threads. \"Simple\" questions go in the Daily Thread. This keeps subreddit traffic organised.\n### 3) State your question clearly in your post title. Mention the subject of your question. Include important keywords. Make it easily searchable.\n### 4) Do not guess or attempt to answer questions beyond your own knowledge. Do not give unfounded guidance or advice. Do not use AI to answer questions. Do not recommend AI as a learning tool.\n### 5) No links to or requests for illegal pirated material. If need be, keep it vague/roundabout or take it to DMs.\n### 6) Memes are only allowed during the weekends.\n### 7) Translation requests are off-topic. Go to r/translator. ([exceptions apply](/r/LearnJapanese/wiki/subredditrules#wiki_rules))\n### 8) Trolling, immature, or hostile behavior will result in a warning or ban. No slurs. No bigotry. No unproductive bickering.\n### 9) **Modmail is defunct.** To contact the mods, leave your message as a comment in the Daily Thread and mention u/Moon_Atomizer or u/Fagon_Drang, or both.\n### 10) To advertise your own content/service (no kana apps), you must first post in the Wednesday \"[Material Recs and Self-Promo](/r/LearnJapanese/search?q=\"weekly+thread%3A+material+recs\"\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\" thread. After getting good reception there, you can ask in the Daily Thread (see rule 9) for **one-time** permission to make a front-page post. Your product will be reviewed by the mods and other subreddit regulars. **Modmail will be ignored.**\n##Resources\nWhether you're a beginner or an expert in the Japanese Language, our index of resources might come in handy. [Check them out here](/r/LearnJapanese/wiki/index/resources)!\n## Furigana (legacy-exclusive)\nTo create furigana in your posts, use the following syntax:\n [漢字](#fg \"かんじ\")\nwill display [漢字](#fg \"かんじ\")\nThe quotation marks are **not** optional.

You ask a question about starting, owning, and growing a small business and the community answers. \nNO business promotion, lead generation, rants, info-tainment, success stories or unsolicited instructional texts, treatise, or how-to's are permitted in posts. \n**Note:** You can post own experiences in the *new* weekly stickied or pinned share-your-experience thread. \n \n* **No blog links and blog content.** \nBlogspam has been defined very early in r/smallbusiness as content that maybe text articles, images, or video. Practically all content, small business-related or not.\n \n**Exceptions** \nAllowed are links or quotes in comments and replies that are relevant to and come normally in the course of discussions.\n* **No business promotion posts.** \nNo business promotion posts are allowed. Promote your business in the weekly Promote-your-business thread only. Offers of free services under the pretense of 'building your portfolio' are considered business promotion, and not permitted in posts.\n**Exceptions**\nYou can promote your business in a relevant reply to a post or comment in other threads providing that is not the main purpose of your account and it is not done repeatedly.\n* **No Personal Attacks, Trolling, or Toxicity.** \n**Exceptions** None, no exceptions.\n* **Negative vote total posts may be removed**\nOverly broad posts may be removed if their vote total is negative and they are reported. For example: questions that ask subscribers for \"pain points\" or needs, about impossible hypotheticals, about what small business to start with $x (with no other info), and similar. You can avoid removal for this reason by searching r/smallbusiness and including indexed links to the same question asked here earlier. Questions showing signs of vote manipulation may also be subject to this rule.\n***************************************************\n**Related Subreddits**\n* [r/SmallBusinessNews](https://reddit.com/r/SmallBusinessNews/) \n* [r/startups](http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/) \n* [r/entrepreneur](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/) \n* [r/business](http://www.reddit.com/r/business/) \n* [r/IndieBiz](http://www.reddit.com/r/indiebiz/) \n* [r/dotcom](http://www.reddit.com/r/dotcom/)\n* [r/advancedentrepreneur](http://www.reddit.com/r/advancedentrepreneur/)\n* [r/Bookkeeping](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bookkeeping/)\n* [r/growmybusiness](https://www.reddit.com/r/growmybusiness)\n* [r/TheBusinessGroup](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBusinessGroup)\n* [r/Emailmarketing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Emailmarketing) \n* [r/SellMyBusiness](https://www.reddit.com/r/SellMyBusiness) \n***************************************************\n**Help With Your Small Business Network**\n* [r/techsupport](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport) \n* [r/inventions](http://www.reddit.com/r/inventions) \n* [r/ArtisanGifts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtisanGifts)\n* [/r/AdspaceMarket](https://www.reddit.com//r/AdspaceMarket) \n***************************************************\n**Location Specific Small Business Subreddit**\n* [/r/canadasmallbusiness](https://www.reddit.com/r/canadasmallbusiness)"},{"display_name":"ClashOfClans","description":"Strategy, how is my base (HIMB), tactics, bugs, crashes, and general discussion welcome! \n[RedditClash Twitter](https://twitter.com/RedditClash)\n### **[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Clashofclans)**\nBe sure to join our Discord Server and connect with your fellow clashers.

This makes others feel welcome and conversation can take place without users being rude to one another.\n- If your entire online personality is to be negative, this isn’t the place for you. You can disagree, but if you intentionally try to get a rise of people, it will be removed and/or subject to a ban.\n- This is also not the place to share anything offensive or behave in an offensive manner.\n#**Encourage Conversation: No simple questions with specific answers** \n- Provide context in the submission text that directly relates to the title.\n- Avoid simple questions with specific answers, Generally, questions with a specific obtainable answer do not provide an avenue of discussion and are usually quickly answered or ignored.\n- The intent of your post should be to spark conversation, so it can help to ask leading questions.\n- If you're new to Reddit, you should check out r/NewToReddit.\n- [More Details\u0026gt;](/r/CasualConversation/w/rules/encourage_conversation)\n#**Stay Casual: Relationship, medical, and legal help/drama is too serious** \n- Stories involving relationships are acceptable if they aren't inherently focused on it, and you're not looking for advice.\n- This isn't the place for medical or mental health advice, including asking for a medical diagnosis, or how to deal with illness, injuries, or mental disorders.\n- Legal advice questions are better suited for professionals who are knowledgeable of the law and legal proceedings.\n- [Recommendations \u0026gt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/rules/advice/)\n#**Stay Calm: Don’t post angry or to vent or complain**\n- We are a place where everyone can forget about their everyday or not so everyday worries for a moment. Venting, complaining, or posting from a place of anger or resentment doesn't fit the atmosphere we try to foster at all.\n- [Recommendations \u0026gt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/rules/venting/)\n#**Stay Positive: Please find better places to express sadness, hardship, and negative mental health**\n- Negative topics don’t lend themselves to casual conversation. These topics are not considered casual and our community is a place to escape from more serious issues.\n- Stories of overcoming negative mental health or hardship can be acceptable by mod discretion if the focus of the post is positive enough and won't lead to negativity in the comments.\n- [Recommendations \u0026gt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/rules/mental_health/)\n#**Keep It Welcoming: Controversial and hot-button topics lead to hostility**\n- Loaded questions or statements could spark an emotional response and get people riled up or start controversy.\n- Reddit meta drama doesn't belong here.\n- Avoid topics that are religious or political in nature. Don’t push an agenda, force beliefs onto others, or belittle another user's view.\n- [Recommendations \u0026gt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/rules/controversial/)\n#**Keep It Clean: Crudeness, NSFW, and gross topics have no place here**\n- This includes discussion on explicit sexual content and bodily functions.\n- If you think you need to flag your post NSFW, it is likely not appropriate to post here.\n- [More Details \u0026gt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/rules/sfw/)\n#**Be Real: No AI and no solicitations like ads, promos, spam, surveys etc.**\n- No AI/ChatGPT and no buying/selling/trading, referral links, or any link that you will profit from (either virtually or physically).\n- This also includes (but is not limited to) promotion of YouTube channels, Spotify, band camp, etc. This is not the sub to attempt to get more views/hits.\n -Surveys are not allowed as they do not promote conversation.\n#**Keep It Safe: Don’t ask for/share personal information/illegal content**\n- Don’t share or seek [personal, identifying information](/r/CasualConversation/w/pi) (real or fake). No private personal information - real name, location, address, workplace, ID numbers, phone, or private e-mail, neither yours (we don't know if it's yours or not) or anybody else's.\n- Avoid discussion on explicit drug use and other illegal content. Laws vary by region, so use your best judgment.\n- [More Details \u0026gt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/rules/privacy/)\n---\n###Mod Applications\n#[📢 Apply to Be a Mod](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQNft07wRiSyPA5BvoFIJo9lpkx5WZhDsF5jnPCq9q7AL7HA/viewform \"Mod Cal\")\n---\n###Moderation Policies [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FCasualConversation#mods)\n#Message the mods for any issues\n- Seriously, we ain't that scary \u0026gt;:)\nWe're happy to help with any issues, concerns or random queries you have.

Memes and humor posts are also not allowed. For such content, please use r/boxofficecirclejerk.\n\u0026gt; 2. **News about a film that can be a jumping-off point for box office predictions is also allowed.** This means trailers, a megathread for critic's reviews, release date announcements, etc. Make sure the film in question is getting a theatrical release, and that the studio reports box office numbers.\n\u0026gt; 3. **All posts need a region flair.** These flairs let people know what region your box office information is about. If the region does not have a specific flair, use the \"International\" flair and mention the region's name in the post title. If a post doesn’t have any particular region associated with it, use \"Other\".\n\u0026gt; 4. **Be respectful to others.** There's no reason to be disrespectful to others, especially since in the end we're just talking about movies here. Flaming and trolling are not allowed. If you disagree with someone about something, you can explain to them why your opinion is different instead of calling them a nasty name. Tagging users to argue about their opinions is also not allowed.\n\u0026gt; 5. **We prefer original and high-quality sources.** The sources in the Box Office Resources section are generally reputable. Websites on [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/wiki/common-clickbait) often post clickbait or rumors, so posts from those domains require manual approval from the moderators. You can get this approval by sending a message to the moderators with the post's URL. The moderators reserve the right to remove posts from other sources if they seem to be of dubious accuracy.\n\u0026gt; 6. **No duplicate content.** Unless the additional source offers new information, there should only be one post per a piece of new news. For questions and discussion topics, at minimum make sure nobody asked the same thing in the past day. The moderators reserve the right to remove other posts as well if they are too repetitive of past threads.\n\u0026gt; 7. **Post titles should reflect the post's content.** No misleading, clickbait-style, or unnecessarily opinionated titles. Feel free to make a post's title different from the title of its source, as long as that new title accurately represents what is in the post.\n\u0026gt; 8. **Tag spoilers for films that are less than a month old.** If a movie was released in the domestic market less than a month ago, tag all spoilers. [Check out this page to see how to make a spoiler tag.](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/wiki/spoiler-tags)\n\u0026gt; 9. **No low effort posts.** Low effort text/poll posts featuring little or no analysis in the body of the text will be removed. This includes but not limited to:\n\"What are your predictions for [insert movie]?\"\n\"Which movie will make more, [insert movie] or [insert movie]?\"\n\"Which movie will open higher on [insert weekend]?\"\nPosts with only a poster (exceptions for Throwback Tuesday).\nWe like for people to throw in a bit more effort in their posts including data, suggestions, analysis, etc.\n\u0026gt; 10. **no self promotion** Don't post a link to promote your website, blog or YouTube channel/videos\n\u0026gt; 11. **\"Let's reminisce about a movie\" posts are only allowed on Tuesday.** They should have a \"Throwback Tuesday\" flair. This includes films released \"on this date\" in a previous year. Please do not spam Throwback Tuesday movies. Post 1 or 2 at most. Any more may be removed at the discretion of the moderators. Throwback posts MUST be anniversaries, in these intervals: 1/5/10/15/20/25/etc.\n\u0026gt; 12. **Don't post links to illegal streaming websites/pirated versions of films.** We don't want to promote piracy nor illegal streaming. Any violation of this rule will result in a ban for the user.\n\u0026gt; 13. **Posts about daily box office updates should be for movies with a certain threshold gross.** Posts about daily box office updates will be allowed if the movie at hand is grossing at least ~$500K daily at the box office. Posts about daily box office updates for movies grossing below ~$500K will be allowed up to ~2 weeks of the movie's release date in the domestic market. Exceptions will be made for certain milestones (e.g. passing $100M).\n\u0026gt; 14. **Stay on topic.** This is a subreddit about numbers, not necessarily about the quality (or lack thereof) of a particular movie. Please remain on-topic and keep opinions/arguments/thoughts about unrelated aspects of the film off of these threads. Any comments that engage in culture war arguments/slapfights (race/gender/sex/\"wokeness\"/etc) will be removed and should be presumed to result in a ban. If your comment can be read as a dog whistle for decreased diversity/representation it will result in a ban.\n\u0026gt; 15. **Usage of Automated Tools for posts and comments is prohibited.** Usage of such tools like optimizing post times and schedules, automatically generating comments, etc. are not allowed and will result in a ban. We like to give every user here a fair share and a chance to create the discussions they like.\n#### [](#icon-info-sign) Box Office Resources\n\u0026gt; **Wiki pages**\n\u0026gt; [Common box office questions FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/wiki/faq)\n\u0026gt; [Common box office terms](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/wiki/terms)\n\u0026gt; [Subreddit traffic stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/wiki/assistantbot_statistics)\n\u0026gt; [An analysis of CinemaScore](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/wiki/cinemascore)\n\u0026gt; [The history of CinemaScore](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/wiki/cinemascore-history)\n\u0026gt; [Historical Box Office Data - 1950-1958] (https://old.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/189vho2/yearly_variety_box_office_rental_data_for_top_100/)\n\u0026gt; [Directors at the box office](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/wiki/directors-at-the-box-office)\n\u0026gt; [How to use spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/wiki/spoiler-tags)\n\u0026gt; [Common clickbait sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/wiki/common-clickbait)\n\u0026gt; **AMAs**\n\u0026gt; [List of AMA posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/wiki/list-of-ama-posts)\n\u0026gt; **Essentials**\n\u0026gt; [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)\n\u0026gt; [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)\n\u0026gt; [Box Office Pro](https://www.boxofficepro.com/) - best known for their long-range forecasts of domestic openings.\n\u0026gt; [Box Office Report](http://www.boxofficereport.com/) - a source for box office updates, with great pages comparing a movie's opening weekend numbers to its trailer views and preview night results.\n\u0026gt; [Box Office Theory](https://forums.boxofficetheory.com/) - popular box office forum.\n\u0026gt; [World of KJ](http://www.worldofkj.com/forum/) - another popular box office forum.\n\u0026gt; **The Trades**\n\u0026gt; [Deadline](https://deadline.com/) - has the most comprehensive box office analysis of all the trades.\n\u0026gt; [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/)\n\u0026gt; [Variety](https://variety.com/)\n\u0026gt; **International Box Office**\n\u0026gt; [entgroup.cn](http://english.entgroup.cn/boxoffice/cn/) - reports on the Chinese box office regularly.\n\u0026gt; [Korean Film Council](http://www.koreanfilm.or.kr/eng/news/boxOffice_Daily.jsp?mode=BOXOFFICE_DAILY) - updates on Korean box office numbers.\n\u0026gt; [InsideKino](https://www.insidekino.de/) - mostly german box office though it has admissions and revenue data on a variety of other, mostly European, markets. \n\u0026gt; [Boxoffice Turkiye](boxofficeturkiye.com) - Turkish Box Office"},{"display_name":"Bass","description":"# [Previous AMAs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/wiki/index#wiki_amas)\n## [FAQ and Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/wiki/faq)\n## [Bass Resources](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/wiki/index)\n## [2016 Official Pedals Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/comments/532q3g/2016_official_rbass_pedals_thread/)\n## [Follow /r/bass on Twitter](https://twitter.com/reddit_bass)\n### [Related Communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/wiki/index#wiki_communities)\nOther Instruments|Build Something|\n:------:|:-------:\n/r/Guitars|/r/Luthier|\n/r/doublebass|/r/DIYGear|\n/r/BassVI|/r/diypedals|\n/r/stick| \n/r/drum|\n/r/tuba| \n/r/Guitar| \nAccessories|Learn\n:------:|:-------:\n/r/guitarpedals|/r/musictheory \n/r/pedals|/r/basslessons \n/r/basspedals |/r/bluesbass\n/r/GuitarAmps |/r/basstabs\n/r/rigtours | /r/tabs\n/r/BassStrings | /r/guitarplaying\nPictures|Deals\n:------:|:-------:\n/r/InstrumentPorn|/r/bassdeals\n/r/offset|/r/Gear4Sale\n/r/jetsonsguitars|\n/r/obscureguitars|\n/r/basspics|\n### Rules\n1.

This community studies the creation of superintelligence— and predict it will happen in the near future, and that ultimately, deliberate action ought to be taken to ensure that the Singularity benefits humanity.\n#####On the Technological Singularity\nThe technological singularity, or simply the singularity, is a hypothetical moment in time when artificial intelligence will have progressed to the point of a greater-than-human intelligence. Because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be difficult for a human to comprehend, the technological singularity is often seen as an occurrence (akin to a gravitational singularity) beyond which the future course of human history is unpredictable or even unfathomable.\nThe first use of the term \"singularity\" in this context was by mathematician John von Neumann. The term was popularized by science fiction writer Vernor Vinge, who argues that artificial intelligence, human biological enhancement, or brain-computer interfaces could be possible causes of the singularity. Futurist Ray Kurzweil predicts the singularity to occur around 2045 whereas Vinge predicts some time before 2030.\nProponents of the singularity typically postulate an \"intelligence explosion\", where superintelligences design successive generations of increasingly powerful minds, that might occur very quickly and might not stop until the agent's cognitive abilities greatly surpass that of any human.\n#####Resources\n* [Machine Intelligence Research Institute](http://www.intelligence.org)\n* [LessWrong](http://www.Lesswrong.com)\n* Follow us at [on twitter](http://twitter.com/r_singularity)\n* [Future of Humanity Institute](http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/)\n* [**H+Pedia**](https://hpluspedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)\n#####Posting Rules\n1) On-topic posts\n2) Discussion posts encouraged\n3) No Self-Promotion/Advertising\n4) Be respectful\n######Check out [/r/Singularitarianism](/r/Singularitarianism) and the Technological Singularity [FAQ](http://intelligence.org/ie-faq/)\n____"},{"display_name":"sydney","description":"\u0026amp;nbsp;\nWe acknowledge the Traditional Custodians of the various lands on which we live and work today and pay respect to Elders past and present and emerging, and extend that respect to other Aboriginal people joining us today.\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n~~**[Ashfield Escalator Status](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/3e9cfceb-c293-4f2a-8cdd-6ccf9e9d2507)**~~\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n**~~[:: Events - If you plan it they will come ::](https://whatson.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/)~~**\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n----\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n**Days Since Last Transport Infrastructure Failure:** **0**\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n**Days Since Last Major Apartment Building Defect:** **0**\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n**Days Since Content Scraped by a Murdoch Minion Masquerading as a \"Journalist\" :** **0**\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n----\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\nLinks relating to the City of Sydney, and NSW in general.

Have you ever had just enough money for an indie game but didn't know whether it was worth buying? Have you ever asked yourself, \"Should I buy this game[?](http://i.imgur.com/jVytZKH.jpg)\"**\nThen you're in luck[.](http://i.imgur.com/NleBgxZ.jpg) Here, you can ask others questions about any game on Steam or any other game on any console, [w](http://i.imgur.com/lO9eYGI.jpg)hether it is about the graphics, the plot, the game play, or even the length. \n----\n**Do not open links to games sent to you through PM, as these often contain malware**\n##Rules\n* 1 - Help Us Help You. When asking for a recommendation, help us by providing context to your question. Give us details about what types of games you enjoy, which games you don't enjoy, and why you're unsure about your purchase. People can't help you make a decision if you don't express yourself. For this reason, we require all posts to be at least 300 characters long. [Why Does Rule 1 (Help Us Help You) Exist?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/wiki/helpushelpyou)\n* 2 - You may not make threads on unreleased content. People can't give you a recommendation on something that no one had the chance to try out.\n* 3 - Touchy Subjects, Appeals: In the cases where the mods have a problem with your conduct and there's no specific rule, moderator decisions stand. For disputes please [Message the Moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/shouldibuythisgame).\n* 4 - **No spoilers without [a](http://i.imgur.com/LNqEe0l.jpg) warning.** Spoilers include, and are not limited to, revealing something about the plot late in the game or explaining an important plot point. This goes for both comments and posts. Mark something as a spoiler by putting the spoiler text in between `\u0026gt;!` and `!\u0026lt;` (with no space in between). It should appear as like this: \u0026gt;!Broodje eats socks!!\u0026lt;\n* 5 - Please no trading here. While giving away games is fine, this is not the place for the trading of games of any sort. Go to /r/SteamGameSwap to do that.\n* 6 - You may not encourage in any way to illegally obtain or modify a game. While we do not care to pry into your own personal decision, we will not allow you to tell others to torrent, pirate, modify, or in any other way get a hold of a game without legal consent of the producer. Paid mods fall in this category, but free mods generally are fine. This goes for both comments and posts.\n* 7 - No spam of any sort, including using the same words or phrases repeatedly, writing nonsense to bypass the minimum character limit, Youtube/Twitch channel promotions, promotion of your own game, repetitive/unwarranted recommendations, or links to websites outside of the normal realm of video game shopping.\n* 8 - No key resellers.\n* 9 - Do not try to profit from our community in any way. This also includes referral or affiliate links when you recommend games. We do make exceptions for giveaways, but only if they are cleared by the moderation team first. Failure to abide by this rule will result in a permanent and irrevocable ban.\n* 10 - Be Cool. This place is chill. We're talking about video games. If you can't be chill, get out. Disagreements are okay, but do not engage in personal attacks, **even in retribution**. Instead of lashing back, report them and move on. Someone breaking the rules does not give you permission to also break the rules.\n* 11 - No Politics: A game subreddit isn't really conducive to political discussion.\n* If you are having any sort of problem with the subreddit, **[don't hesitate to contact a mod.](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FShouldIbuythisgame)**\n##Post Format\n**SIB** *name of game* [specific info]?\n**WSIB** [specific info]?\n****\n**SIB** = Should I Buy\n**WSIB** = What Should I Buy\n****\n**Titles should be short and concise.** In the description of your post, describe why, how, and what you are confused about.

No flame wars, disrespect, condescension based on level of experience, or tactless posts stereotyping any group of people will be tolerated. If you disagree with something, make your case politely. Repeated or egregious offenses will be countered with a ban.*\n### **Stay relevant**\n* *Please submit only content and discussion that is specifically relevant to music production. If your thread is only tangentially related, it is probably considered off-topic. If your thread is vague, unclear, or easily answered by searching (\"does anyone else...?\" \"Any suggestions for...?\") it may be removed.*\n### **No memes/images/low-effort content**\n* *Keep it productive, intelligent, intelligible, and constructive.*\n### **No spam or self-promotion**\n* *Spam \u0026amp; self-promotion (outside of the Marketplace thread, where ads are encouraged) will be removed. Users posting links to tracks for views or feedback, soliciting/offering services, promoting fan pages, using follow-gates/download-gates, or otherwise benefiting financially from the sub will be banned for a day and informed to read the rules. If you're not sure if your post will fit or not, message the moderators.*\n### **No piracy or illegal content**\n* *Advocating, asking for, or giving advice on how to pirate is prohibited. Linking to piracy-centric subs also prohibited. 7 day ban on first offense, permanent ban thereafter.*\n### **No \"drama posts\"**\n* *This is not the place for posts about discovering people stealing songs from other artists or producers using ghost writers, etc. This is a community for the technical aspects of production and for production discussion, not drama. If your post is calling someone out for something, it's probably not appropriate here.*\n### **No \"motivation posts\"**\n* *Lower-effort \"motivational\" threads asking how to get through an artistic slump may be removed because they've been answered quite a few times before. Use the subreddit search or check out other subreddits such as /r/getmotivated. We occasionally will make exceptions to threads that create insightful discussion.*\n### **Use the weekly threads**\n* *Weekly Threads are listed in the top bar. All postings of your own music (thread or comment) for any reason should go in the Feedback thread. All products/services should go in the Marketplace Thread. Collab calls should go in the Collaboration Thread. Questions that don't warrant a thread go in the \"There Are No Stupid Questions\" Thread. Violations of this rule will result in a 1-day ban.*\n### **Use clear and concise titles**\n* *The purpose of your post must be clear by reading your title. Threads that do not conform will be removed without notice. Mods will not look at the content of the post before the removal. *Make the title clear and concise.* *\n****\nSearch the subreddit before making a post."},{"display_name":"homeowners","description":"If you have questions about home projects, maintenance, repairs, or even buying your first home, this is the place to ask.\nThis sub is not for promotion (self- or otherwise).

A bit long, but features some truly great stuff and has very often been misrepresented in media. This is not the story you may think you know from other adaptations and has a lot going for it like Black Cat.\n[If This Be My Destiny...](https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/6716/the_amazing_spider-man_1963_31)||[](#3-destiny)**[If This Be My Destiny...](https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/6716/the_amazing_spider-man_1963_31)**: (ASM Vol 1/1963 #31-33).

Mac Gargan is often regarded as one of the worst hosts for the Venom symbiote. And while I generally agree, this often overlooked 4-part miniseries really is something special. Written by Brian Reed, we see Mac working for Norman Osborn’s Dark Avengers and how he handles being disguised as Spider-Man. The miniseries is delightfully twisted and laugh out loud funny.

Please report bad advice to the mod team.\n---\n**2) Keep discussion friendly, civil, courteous, and professional.** We're here to help so being rude won't help.

Those who continually cause issue will be removed**\n---\n**3)** Only one vehicle/problem/incident per thread, and only post once.

We allow links, pictures, video, or audio file to help diagnose your problem. **Linking for the purposes of promotion (eg offers/coupons/self blog posts/youtube/advertisements/how to) is strictly prohibited and will result in a permanent ban.

However, please observe rule #1 when asking for a second opinion. It is considered rude to ask, “Is the shop trying to fleece/rip me off?” You wouldn’t ask “Why are all cops pigs?” on /r/AskLeo, ask about Creationism on /r/AskScience, or talk about vaccines causing autism on /r/AskDocs.\nGenerally there is a good reason why a repair costs what it does. We are more than happy to help you figure out why a shop wants to charge you for a repair, and we will tell you if it is unusually high.

Centered around the discussion of JRPGs.\n**Allowed Submissions** \n \n* JRPG News\n* Informative self-posts \n* Trailers \u0026amp; Promotional Gameplay \n* Discussions and Questions about JRPGs\n \n___\n##Rules Clarifications Page\n- [Rules Clarification Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/wiki/rules) - This page has a thorough write up of each of our subreddit's rules with explanations and more to keep in mind. \n- Reposts will also be removed or consolidated together to avoid cluttering, in most cases.\n- If your post disappears, please [contact the moderators in modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FJRPG) to see if it got caught in the spam filter or for other questions or concerns.\n---\n##Read the Rules Before Posting\n(**Hover your mouse over a rule to read the full description**)\n \n###Rule 1. No excessive promotion or self-promotion\n- We only allow promoting content (yours or someone else’s) if you have been actively participating in the last 2 months before the post with worthwhile comment on other users' threads, and limit yourself to 1 per 7 days.\n- Let’s play/stream posts are not allowed.\n- **If you are a developer, follow the next rule instead**\n- Users who don't fulfill this requirement may use the Weekly Media Thread.\n###Rule 2. Developer/publisher posts\n- If you are a developer or publisher occasionally sharing a notable new about your game (announcement, release, AMA, etc.) you can post it; but excessively posting about the same project or only sharing minor updates about it is subject to removal.\n- It must be a text post with a proper description about the game and include any necessary official links.\n- If you are unsure if your post will be allowed or not, please contact the mod team via modmail. You can also use the Weekly Media Thread.\n###Rule 3. No untagged spoilers\n- Use spoiler tags if needed (important events/twists/bosses/etc).\n- Posts tagged as Spoiler that do not say the game name(s) in the title must still use spoiler tags in the body of the post.\n- Comments containing spoilers must specify the game being spoiled outside of the hidden spoiler text.\n- To tag, use the \"!\" button on New Reddit, or use \u0026gt;! and !\u0026lt; marks like:\n \u0026gt;!X kills Y!\u0026lt;\n- (Do not put a \"space\" next to the \"!\" mark as it breaks on Old Reddit.)\n- This appears as \u0026gt;!X kills Y!\u0026lt;, for example.\n###Rule 4. No off-topic posts\n- Content should be related to Japanese-style Role Playing Video Games. Unrelated content will be removed.\n- The only exception are news and discussion posts about sequels, spin-offs or other media that isn’t JRPG but whose story is directly related to a JRPG, but only to discuss about their story in relation to the JRPG (e.g.: news about an anime adaptation or a sequel that isn’t a JRPG but continues the story is allowed, but not gameplay questions or a character being added to a crossover title).\n###Rule 5. Rules for game recommendation type posts\n- Posts asking for games must include a description with at least 300 characters (letters, not words). They also must list the desired platform, past played/enjoyed games, and desired aspects (combat style, subgenre, setting...).\n- Common requests (e.g.: “best game in X console”, “games with female protagonist”, “mature JRPGs”, “turn-based games”) should go in /r/gamingsuggestions or our weekly suggestion thread. Check out our wiki for lists of common recommendations.\n###Rule 6. No low-effort posts\n- No low-effort threads (one line questions, one poll, one image, etc.) without proper context/elaboration. This includes memes \u0026amp; funny videos. You can resubmit as a text post with the image, poll, etc. and proper details/context to elaborate on it or use the Weekly threads.\n- Common questions (e.g.: \"which game in X series should I play first?\", \"how many games are there in X series?\") should be posted in the dedicated weekly thread. \n- Buying/selling threads can go to r/GameSale.\n- Asking \"**What is a JRPG**\" or some variation of this question.\n###Rule 7. Be civil and don't use personal attacks against other redditors.\n- Be civil. Personal attacks, insults, harassment or such behavior to other users is not tolerated. \n- Follow Reddit's Official Content Policy, esp. Rule 1: Remember the human. Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. Communities and users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.\n###Rule 8. Only notable news for gacha/mobile/MMO games\n- News about gacha/mobile/MMO games should be limited to major updates (for example: the announcement or release of a new game or an expansion). Minor updates (for example: a minor patch, the release of a new character or a seasonal event) should be posted in r/gachagaming, r/mobilegaming or the specific game subreddit.\n- Discussion about these kind of games is allowed.\n \n___\n###**Scheduled JRPG [Weekly Discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/search?q=Author%3Aautomoderator+weekly\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;include_over_18=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)**\n* **Friday**: Free Talk, Quick Questions and Suggestion Request, and Media.\n* **Sunday**: What have you been playing, and what do you think of it?\n---\n##Filter Threads by Flair\n---\n#[News](/r/JRPG/search?q=flair%3A%27news%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all) [Trailer](/r/JRPG/search?q=flair%3A%27Trailer%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all) [Release](/r/JRPG/search?q=flair%3A%27Release%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all) [Sale!](/r/JRPG/search?q=flair%3A%27Sale!%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all)\n#[Discussion](/r/JRPG/search?q=flair%3A%27discussion%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all) [Question](/r/JRPG/search?q=flair%3A%27Question%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all) [Review](/r/JRPG/search?q=flair%3A%27Review%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all)\n#[Interview](/r/JRPG/search?q=flair%3A%27Interview%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all) [Video](/r/JRPG/search?q=flair%3A%27Video%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all) [Article](/r/JRPG/search?q=flair%3A%27Article%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all) [AMA](/r/JRPG/search?q=flair%3A%27AMA%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all)\n[Recommendation request](/r/JRPG/search?q=flair%3A%27Recommendation%2Brequest%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all) \n#[Translation News](/r/JRPG/search?q=flair%3A%27Translation%2Bnews%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all) [Name that game](/r/JRPG/search?q=flair%3A%27Name%2Bthat%2Bgame%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all)\n#[Weekly thread](/r/JRPG/search?q=flair%3A%27Weekly%2Bthread%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all) [Meta](/r/JRPG/search?q=flair%3A%27Meta%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all) \n___\n##Useful Links\n- [Links to JRPG-related Discord servers](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/wiki/discords)\n- [Other Subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/wiki/jrpg_subreddits)\n- [Useful Non-Reddit Sites](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/wiki/jrpg_subreddits#wiki_links_outside_of_reddit)\n \n---\n##Easy Access Buttons\n(Click on the button to access the content)\n# [\u0026gt; The r/JRPG Wiki \u0026lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/wiki/index)\nEnjoy browsing information gathered by JRPG fans throughout the years, and help grow it even more.\n-----\n# [\u0026gt; The Complete JRPG list \u0026lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/wiki/complete_list_of_jrpgs)\nTake your time looking through our list of JRPGs, and help us keep it update.\n-----\n# [\u0026gt; Where Do I start with \"X\" series \u0026lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/wiki/playorder)\nYou don't know where to start with a certain well known JRPG series ?

This means being kind to those you disagree with. \nBehaviors such as shaming, mocking, ranting, advocating violence, and threatening (including threats of self-harm) other users, third parties, groups, or businesses will be met with removals and bans. This includes content that leads to or promotes on- or off-site witch-hunting, abuse, or harassment in any way. \nBe excellent to each other.\n###Rule #2 - Inclusivity\nRespect others' differences, be they race, religion, home, job, gender identity, ability, vulnerability, or sexuality. When faced with a removal or ban, \"I was just joking!\" or \"it was obviously sarcasm\" are not acceptable excuses.\nDehumanizing language and slurs are instant bans. \n###Rule #3 - Accuracy\nDo not deviate from news headlines when sharing news articles. Save your opinions for sharing in comments within the post. \nModerators reserve the right to remove posts about extreme experiences at the team's discretion if the information or source is unverifiable and/or sensationalized.\nPlease avoid posting information that can be easily proven false, including science denial like anti-vaxx messaging or disputing climate change.\n###Rule #4 - Topic Guidelines\nAll submissions should be relevant to Metro Vancouver and the surrounding areas. Topics and news about British Columbia or Canada may be allowed within mod discretion.\n**Duplicate new posts will be removed.** Basic and common questions should go on /r/AskVan or relevant subreddits, not /r/Vancouver. This includes legal, tenancy, polls, moving, travel, and more. Questions, rants, and PSAs are allowed with moderator discretion only.\n[See the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/wiki/faq) for more details as this is a complicated rule.\n###Rule #5 - Spam, Selling, and Promotion\nNo unauthorized promotion, job-seeking, buy/sell, referral/affiliate links, crowdfunding campaigns, surveys, or petitions. We define spam as more than one promoting submission for nine unrelated pieces of content. Moderator discretion may be used when proactively identifying and actioning astroturfing and/or stealth promotion. \nWe automatically remove low-quality domains and UTM tracking links.\nAbide by Reddit's content policy, [found here](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy).\n##Check out our [Monthly Events and Promotions Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/about/sticky?num=2). \n---\n##FAQ \u0026amp; QuickLinks: \n[/r/AskVan - for questions about Vancouver](https://www.reddit.com/r/askvan/) \n[Moving to Vancouver](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/wiki/faq#wiki_i.27m_moving_to_vancouver.21_what_should_i_do.3F) \n[Visiting Vancouver](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/wiki/faq#wiki_i.27m_visiting_vancouver.21_what_do_i_do.3F) \n[Transit in Vancouver: A Guide](https://www.reddit.com//r/vancouver/wiki/transit) \n[Low-Income and Free Resource Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/wiki/low-income-resources) \n[Related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/wiki/faq/#wiki_what_other_subreddits_should_i_follow.3F) \n[How do I start hiking?](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/wiki/faq#wiki_hiking_sounds_fun.21_how_do_i_get_started.3F) \n[Landlord help](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/wiki/faq#wiki_i_need_landlord_help.21_where_do_i_start.3F)"},{"display_name":"hiphopheads","description":"###Welcome to \\/r\\/HipHopHeads!\n##**[/r/Hiphopheads COVID-19 Donations Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/g6tx5b/rhiphopheads_covid19_donations_thread/)**\nThe latest music, videos \u0026amp; news relating to your favorite hip-hop \u0026amp; R\u0026amp;B artists.

Doors, walls, furniture and floors, popcorn ceilings *and* ceiling fans. Appliances, kitchen utensils, drills, chainsaws, and machines of all ilk. Someone here is going to try to help you fix it when it's busted.\n____\n### What we do \nWe strive above all to be a sub that provides a community service, and as such we hold ourselves to certain standards. Keep the comments on-topic, you can make jokes, it's fine, just don't go off the rails. Do not market anything here without asking the mods first (spoiler, we're gonna say no), don't be posting links to Amazon.com with affiliate codes in them either. Don't post about things you've already solved or made, /r/DIY is a better place for that. \n### Passing good fixes forward\nFurther to this goal of providing a service; If someone's comment provides you with a working solution to your issue (or if you just plain figure it out for yourself) post a comment singling out what the solution ultimately was and please flair your post as **Fixed**. Hopefully this will let future readers learn from our collective successes.\n___ \n### Posting for Maximum Effect \n####When you make your submission, post a *detailed* description of your issue and the friendly users here will do their best to sort you out.\n#### **Do your best to include:**\n* #### A *detailed* description of the problem.\n* #### Detailed photos are often a plus. This can mean, for example, close up photos of a part ***as well*** as photos from farther back, and/or different angles, which give significant context.\n* #### If there is a part number or a model number on something you suspect or know to be at issue definitely include that.\n* #### A description of the event(s) or circumstances that lead up to or were present at the time the issue arose.\n____\n### Safety\nThere are things that are too dangerous for us to handle here. This can include certain electrical jobs, or natural gas plumbing jobs for example. Rule of thumb, if there's *any* reasonable chance you could get hurt or killed if something went awry you'll probably be directed to find yourself an expert.\n___\n### Basic Decorum \n#### [][behave]Don't engage in racism, sexism, creeedism, homophobia, transphobia, or general assholery. **The banhammer is swift and unforgiving**. \n___\n### Last but not least.

Please provide your recipe written out, not just a link, in the body of your post. If your recipe is video based, write out the recipe. Not everyone can watch a video when they see your post.** This will ensure you get the best answers. \nPlease avoid requests for recipes for specific ingredients or dishes.\nPrompts for general discussion or advice are discouraged outside of our official Weekly Discussion (for which we're happy to take requests). As a general rule, if you are looking for a variety of good answers, go to /r/Cooking. For the one right answer, come to /r/AskCulinary. \nIf its a topic or question that is easy to google, google it.\nYou can post a photo using third party hosting sites like imgur.\nWe're also avoiding brand recommendations or comparisons for kitchen equipment and other products/ingredients. Preferences tend to be subjective and personal. Few people have enough experience with multiple brands to make useful comparisons. \nWe're best at:\n* Troubleshooting dishes/menus\n* Equipment questions (about specific items with specific problems)\n* Food science\n* Questions about technique\nQuestions about what is healthy and unhealthy are outside of the scope of this subreddit. But if you have a culinary question that takes into account some specified dietary needs, we'll do our best to help.\nFood safety questions are difficult for us to answer, so please instead see [USDA's](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation) topic portal, the [StillTasty](https://www.stilltasty.com/) website, and if in doubt, throw it out. \nThere are also better subs for professional questions. We focus on helping home cooks here. If you have questions about the business, we will refer you to /r/chefit or /r/KitchenConfidential, and wish you luck. \nIf you see a wrong answer, report it.

Our much larger subreddit is actually devoted to discussing Catholicism. \r\n\r\n**Q:** **How is flair used here?** \r\n**A:** Currently, we use flairs for offices. If you see users flaired, they have been verified by the moderators. We are unlikely to have self-applied flair anytime in the near future (search for the topic here to understand why). \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Official Community Groups\r\n\r\n* [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VkxKJqz)\r\n* [Steam group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/rcatholicism)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Mass Readings for Today\r\n\r\n[NAB](http://www.usccb.org/bible/readings/) (US·Philippines) \r\n[ESV-CE](https://universalis.com/europe.england/mass.htm) (UK·Ireland) \r\n[NRSV-CE](https://readings.livingwithchrist.ca/) (Canada) \r\n[RSV-CE](https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/daily-readings) (Antilles) \r\n[L.

This sub is for people with a wide variety of views, and as such you will come across content, views and people you don't agree with. Political views from a wide spectrum are tolerated here. Engagement in antagonistic, uncivil, abusive, or harassing behaviour (including personal insults or group-based attacks) will result in action being taken against your account.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; ---\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **2:** Anything not specifically concerning politics in the UK or geopolitics involving the UK will be removed.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; ---\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **3:** Link submission titles should use the headline of the article / content (or the full, unaltered text of the Tweet including the author's name) being submitted, and should be changed only where it improves clarity or is absolutely necessary. Please use a link to the original publisher where possible. Including \"body text\" on a link submission will result in your submission being removed. Your personal opinion should always be expressed in the comments - not elsewhere.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; ---\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **4a:** News articles older than 28 days may be removed. If an older article has relevance to events being discussed today, you should outline this argument in a self post that links to said article. On days where events move particularly fast, moderators may remove outdated news regardless of age.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **4b:** Long form journalism published more than twelve months prior or before significant developments to the topic it discusses should be submitted as part of a self-post detailing why it is relevant today.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; ---\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **5a:** Articles from paywalled sites should be linked to directly, and a copy/paste of the article text provided in the comments. Full credit to the author and publication should be given. Some websites may have different conditions applied due to copyright issues or differences in the design of their paywall, and result in automated instructions being sent which explain how to submit their content correctly.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt; **5b:** You may use an archive site instead of copy/paste, but only if a copy/paste is not suitable for the paywalled content (e.g. if there are a number of supporting charts / diagrams).\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt; **5c:** Articles which are submitted from non-paywalled sites should not be copy/pasted as a comment.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; ---\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **6:** Links to \"live\" pages (i.e. pages where the content is frequently updated with new developments) are not permitted and will be removed.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; ---\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **7a:** Tweets are acceptable, so long as they are from journalists, pollsters, politicians and so forth. Tweets from random members of the public are not. This is auto-moderated as per our whitelist, but tweets from non-white listed accounts may be approved depending on context and notability. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **7b:** Twitter posts which do not contribute substance or contain reactionary commentary regardless of author will generally be removed as \"hot takes\". However, exceptional circumstances aside, tweets from sitting MPs are not likely to be removed.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **7c:** Threads should be submitted as a link submission identifying the Twitter thread in the title where possible. The contents of a thread should be posted as a text comment or link to an appropriate Thread Reader url.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **7d:** Tweets that are just a link to an article and contain no commentary of substance will be removed. Said articles should submitted in place of the tweet with the accompanying tweet linked to in the comments.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **7e:** Other social media sources or accounts that don't fit the criteria will continue to be reviewed manually.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; ---\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **8:** Submitting your own content is perfectly fine, but make it clear that it's your own content and [read the site wide guidance on self promotion written by the admins](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; ---\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **9:** Campaigning, fundraising, activism, e-begging and links to petitions will be removed. We all have issues that are close at heart, but the subreddit isn't the place for this. \n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; ---\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **10:** Self posts should be used as an invitation to discussion, not an opportunity to soapbox, tub-thump or showboat.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; ---\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **11:** No meme posts, no shitposts. Low-effort top-level replies to submissions will be removed.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; ---\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **12:** Posting surveys is not permitted without prior approval from the subreddit moderators.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; ---\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **13:** No URL shorteners, your post or comment will be immediately removed.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; ---\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **14:** Flairs should not contain links or abuse/insults. User flair that contains either will be deleted without warning, repeat offenders will be banned.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; ---\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **15:** Low-effort complaining about sources, insulting the publication or trying to shame users for posting sources you disagree with is not acceptable. Either address the post in question, or ignore it.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt; ---\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **16:** Moderation action will be taken against racist, sexist, homophobic, or other hateful comments regarding religion, race, or other identities. However, It is important to note that critical discussions about immigration, refugee policy, or cultural/religious practices do not automatically constitute hate speech.\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; ---\n\u0026gt; \n\u0026gt; **17:** This is not a meta subreddit.

[Be mature and respectful to others](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/wiki/moderation_policy#wiki_text_moderation_policy) - We're all here in our own time, so please help us enjoy that time by keeping discussion civil, this includes using insults or writing derogatory comments. We don't remove posts simply for being brash.\n2. [Read the FAQ before asking basic questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/wiki/faq) - For cases where user makes a vague and unhelpful \"What language should I learn?\" post or asks an already-answered question. FAQ are usually removed.\n3. [Do not submit self-owned content too frequently](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/wiki/moderation_policy#wiki_post_type.3A_user-owned_content) - Users may only post self-owned content if it is good quality and posting is infrequent (less than once a month).

Do not focus your post on a specific language - Posts about popular languages belong in their subs. Posts about rarer languages are usually okay. Posts about learning techniques/schedules are sometimes okay--check the longer rules.\n6. Do not post [low-quality content](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/wiki/moderation_policy#wiki_golden_rule.3A_please_be_respectful_to_others) - We only remove very low-quality posts.

[Do not generalise large groups of people](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/wiki/moderation_policy#wiki_golden_rule.3A_please_be_respectful_to_others) - This includes spreading conspiracy theories or isolated or misleading statistics regarding groups of people.\n8.

There have been countless meta posts complaining about characters or explanations as to why X is overrated, and so on. So the purpose of this sub is to allow those who *want* to rant about a character or series.\n___\n___\n[Join our Discord!](https://discord.gg/E92zdkH)\n___\n___\n##**Rules:**\n1. [**Don't be a jerk:**](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205701155) It's okay to talk about characters, because you won't hurt their feelings. Terms like \"fanboy\" and other negative labels are looked down upon, and just straight up goes against Reddit's [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/). Cussing to enhance a statement is acceptable, but if the cussing is clearly directed towards a user with ill intent, there will be [consequences](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/#section_enforcement).\n2. **Don't make things up:** Fabrication will not be tolerated. If you make a claim against an evidenced source, burden of proof is on you to provide counterevidence. If evidence is requested and not presented, the mods maintain the right to remove the claim at their leisure. In addition, repeat offenses or a pattern of behavior that leads the moderators to believe a user is trolling with intent of bait will face an administrative decision.\n3. **Don't downvote:** If you disagree with a thread or comment, refer to Rule 2 and debate the point, or accept you don't care that much about it. Downvotes encourage arguments based on popularity, and not on the quality of the arguments.\n4. [**Do not ask for votes or engage in vote manipulation**](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/#section_prohibited_behavior). **DO NOT create multiple accounts to evade punishment or avoid restrictions**. You will be banned on the spot, even if you are suspected for it.\n5. **Don't link to other communities or posts in a negative or even neutral manner:** Linking to specific posts from r/whowouldwin or elsewhere can be harmful and considered brigading, and will result in a ban. If you really feel the need to show a comment or thread, screenshot it and censor usernames and links.\n6. **Allowed Thread Topics:** [Read this post to know what can and can't be posted on CR](https://old.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/1clbns3/what_can_and_definetly_cant_be_posted_on_the_sub/). You may talk about why you like or dislike a specific character, why you think a specific character is overestimated or underestimated. You may talk about and clear up any misconceptions you've seen about a specific character or setting. You may talk about a fictional event that has happened, or a concept such as ki, chakra, or speedforce.\n7. **Do not post a thread as a reply to another thread.** Reddit will notify the user of your reply when you post it, there's no need to create an entirely separate post to address the \"issue\".\n8. **No NSFW Content.** This is not a NSFW subreddit and is not recognized as one by Reddit. Do not post threads that contains explicit sexual content. Acceptable NSFW content would be using evidence that may contain nudity as a relevant response to give a source, as long as properly marked.\n9. **General questions** are considered meta, including, but not limited to: vague, opinion based, \"all of fiction\", or fan theory related questions. These require mod approval and will be removed without warning. Additionally, any rant that consists of solely a question must be putting forth a thesis/attempting to start a dialogue; simply asking a question and not taking a stance is fit for AskReddit or AskScienceFiction. Questions about a specific feat, or context are fine. If your post is removed and you feel you were wronged, please message the moderation team.\n10. **Do not post low effort threads** consisting of nothing but a short statement or opinion of yours (\"I don't like this character, bye\"). Users are expected to bring forth a bare minimum amount of discussion in their posts. Threads for memes, baiting, trolling and mere jokes in general also don't belong here, and will be removed at our discretion. However, \"low effort\" threads will be allowed on Sundays. If your post was removed due to being low effort, just save it for Sunday or add more to it.\n11. **Spoilers:** Do not post or comment on anything spoiler related without a spoiler tag. CharacterRant's definition of a spoiler is defined as any form of media that hasn't been given **a reasonable enough amount of time** to allow the community equal time to view it. **A reasonable enough amount of time** 4 weeks from the release date of a movie, 3 weeks from the release date of a video game, 2 weeks from the release date of a comic chapter, manga chapter, or television episode. To tag a spoiler [Text here]\\(/spoiler) OR [Your words here]\\(#spoiler). \n12. **Overdone Rants:** When rants focusing on a certain topic start to oversaturate the CharacterRant with very little or no new light being shined on the topic, they can be temporarily banned. Thread topics that show up here aren't allowed to posted until they become removed: pedophilia \n13. **Titles:** Posts must have the media name in the thread. There may be exceptions to this rule if the rant's title already includes a character that the series is named after (ex. Naruto or Samurai Jack) or if the rant is about more general topics or if the rant brings up multiple different series as examples. Abbreviations don't count (such as JJK instead of Jujutsu Kaisen).\n \n___\n___\n##**Guidelines:**\n1. **Meta posts:** Please ask for mod approval before posting a meta post. We will more than likely say yes, unless you're advertising.\n2. **Reposts and copycats:** if your thread covers the *exact same topic* and expresses the *same opinion* of a thread that was posted less than 6 months ago and that has more than 100 upvotes, your thread will be removed.\n3. **Making a battleboarding post?** Visit **r/respectthreads** for high-quality compilations of feats from characters!\n___\n___\n___\n___"},{"display_name":"hometheater","description":"---------\n**Soundbars**\n99.9% of the time **Soundbars** or HTiB (Home Theater in a Box) systems are not a good investment of your time and money. \nIt is the general consensus of r/hometheater not to recommend these things and instead simply steer a user toward a 2.0 or 2.1 system made of quality, *Audio-Centric* name brand components which are easy to assemble and cheap enough for low budget or space conscious buyers. \nMost can be expanded to 5.1 if you buy the correct items in the correct order. \nFor further explanation please read [Why You Shouldn't Buy a Soundbar](https://www.reddit.com/r/HTBuyingGuides/comments/dy885l/why_you_shouldnt_buy_a_soundbar/)\nPlease be aware /r/Soundbars exists as well as you will be met with opposition to posting about soundbars here.\n---------\n**Rules**\nI. **Be Excellent to each other** - Comments containing insults or unconstructive criticism may be removed at moderator discretion. Report comments that cross the line rather than retaliating. We are here to share information \u0026amp; ideas about a shared hobby. A disagreement or difference of opinion does not warrant personal attacks of any kind. Keep in mind that everyone is in a different part of their home theater journey \u0026amp; may have differing priorities\nII. **Discussions of illegal activity prohibited** - Read, understand, and follow the reddit Content Policy: https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy No aiding piracy, even if it is legal in your country. Reddit is US based, so for the continued existence of the sub we follow their rules\nIII. **Moderators reserve the right to remove your post at our discretion** - Moderators have final say over any and all posts or comments. They can be removed at our discretion for any reason, including but not limited to off-topic posting \u0026amp; misinformation. Posts containing soundbars are considered off-topic for this subreddit and may be removed. “Discussion” or “Purchasing” advice posts comparing soundbars to modular sound systems are allowed. YouTube links at moderator discretion.\nIV. **No self-promotion** - This subreddit is not to be leveraged for the financial benefit of any user. You may not promote a service, product, or publication with which you are associated. Failure to disclose a financial association will result in a ban. Products provided or discounted in exchange for a post/comment/review constitute a financial relationship with the providing company. Directing traffic to your own monetized YouTube channel or video is prohibited.\nV. **No deal posts** - Posts including deals, sales, used finds, or requests for pricing on a specific item will be removed. Please keep discussion of these topics within the “Weekly Deals Thread” to avoid cluttering the subreddit. Comments discussing current pricing of components within “Purchasing” advice posts are still permissible\nVI. **No referral links or link shortening** - Referral links (including Amazon Smile) allow others to potentially make money. Third party link shortening leads to redirects \u0026amp; potentially harmful websites. Amazon links need to be in the format www.amazon.com/dp/B00VRRVHMA/ - all the extra stuff after those 10 characters is unnecessary. First party link shorteners from mobile apps like Amazon and YouTube will be allowed.\nVII. **No meta [suggestions] posts or comments** - Please send suggestions to the moderators through Modmail instead by clicking [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fhometheater).\nVIII. **Do not message mods via their private inbox** - Messaging mods via their private inbox rather than mod mail will result in a ban and your messages ignored. Please send suggestions to the moderators through Modmail instead by clicking [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fhometheater).\nIX. **No pictures of boxes** - Pictures of your gear set up are encouraged! Pictures of products still in boxes are low effort \u0026amp; low quality content that will be removed.\n**General Posting Guidelines**\n* Please Flair your post\n* Many questions have already been answered, USE SEARCH \u0026amp; See [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/HTBuyingGuides/comments/u7khtz/home_theater_101_the_new_frequently_asked/).\n* When requesting help for issues POST DETAILS, MODELS, \u0026amp; PICS.

language\n请务必使用中文交流，保证纯中文用户的浏览体验。外语内容不受板规保护。\n转载非中文帖文，必须将标题原样翻译成中文，并在评论区提供正文翻译，或至少简要描述内容。\n### 2. 真诚友善、尊重他人\n请记住，网线另一端也是活生生的人。不得基于民族、地域、宗教、性别等他人身份而发表[歧视或仇恨言论](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AD%A7%E8%A7%86%E8%AF%AD)，不得[人身攻击](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BA%BA%E8%BA%AB%E6%94%BB%E6%93%8A)、[扣帽子、贴标签](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%89%A3%E5%B8%BD%E5%AD%90)，不得实施威胁、辱骂、公开个人隐私等[网络暴力](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF%E9%9C%B8%E5%87%8C)行为。\n### 3. 维护讨论氛围，不钓鱼、不引战\n提倡相互尊重，鼓励有理有据、友善地进行讨论。不欢迎钓鱼、引战，刻意制造对立，破坏社区氛围的行为。\n### 4. 正确使用标题\n标题必须使用平和、友善、不带个人立场或情绪的[描述性语言](https://www.jianshu.com/p/4fdeb2ac91bc)，不得使用[歧视性用语](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AD%A7%E8%A7%86%E8%AF%AD)或极端且带鲜明立场的词汇，不应带有[评价性语言](https://www.jianshu.com/p/4fdeb2ac91bc)，不允许[标题党](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%A0%87%E9%A2%98%E5%85%9A)、[震惊体](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn/%E9%9C%87%E6%83%8A%E4%BD%93)。转载不得擅自修改为煽动性的表述。\n转发内容必须使用原标题，标题非中文的请将标题原样翻译成中文，没有原标题的应当在标题栏对转载的内容作[事实描述](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/312210656)。\n### 5. 保证发帖质量\n发主题帖请避免低劣的排版或内容，不要过于水贴（如一句话提问、一句话感想、一句话投票，或是频繁发相同类型的帖子）。\n投票贴请使用 Reddit 自带的 Poll 功能，并简要描述该投票涉及的背景和原因。\n任何形式的自我推广、问卷调查、捐助请求或其他涉及金钱的交易行为必须[事先通过 ModMail 征求板务同意](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/qyqk63/)，请不要在未经板务允许的情况下自行发布相关内容。\n请避免提交近期已有他人发过的重复话题。建议发帖前先[用 Google 搜索板面](https://www.google.com/search?q=%E5%8F%91%E8%BF%87%E4%BA%86+site%3Areddit.com%2Fr%2FChina_irl)。\n### 6. 规范转载\n转发应当直接提交链接（Link Post）；若因链接失效、需付费（Paywall）、需注册、担忧会被删除等缘故，可以截图（Image Post）或文字（Self Post）转载，但需要在评论区标明来源。\n请尽量寻找可信的[一手来源](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%A1%E6%96%87%E7%8C%AE)，如实际撰写报道的报纸、电台或通讯社，避免链接到内容聚合网站（如新浪、搜狐）。请不要链接[内容农场](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%A7%E5%AE%B9%E8%BE%B2%E5%A0%B4)（如百家号、文学城）或[不可信来源](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/qoisyd/)（如法轮功、RFA）。\n对于社交平台上的发言，如果以截图（Image Post）的形式转载，公众人物和机构的发言可以直接转发，但非公众人物（没有加 V 的普通网友或小范围的网红）的发言，其帖文和评论中的所有 ID 都需要打码处理。不要以「奇文共赏」、「欢乐群嘲」为目的恶意转发其他社区的评论。\n### 7. 不讨论海外小圈子话题\n请避免无趣且与国内民众生活没有直接关联内容。允许重大国际新闻、海外观点讨论等严肃内容，海外地区本地新闻会依据影响力以及与国内民众生活相关性等具体情况做判断，一般不予保留。\n欢迎在我们的姐妹板块 r/Chinatown_irl 交流海外地区本地话题。\n### 8. 谨慎发布 NSFW 内容\n发布 NSFW 内容（包括色情、血腥、暴力等可能让人不适的内容）时请勾选「NSFW」标签，并确保您发布的内容符合其他板规。请勿滥用 NSFW 标签。使用 NSFW 标签的帖文可能会被板务移除。\n### 9. 禁止跨社区引流和骚扰行为\n不欢迎跟同温层（echo chamber）社区的互动交流，不允许将不符合板规的同温层帖文转到本板，或将本板帖文恶意引流到其他同温层社区。\n不得在外部社区挂本板用户的言论或帐号，或在本板挂外部社区的言论或帐号。\n不应将本板贴文转发到用户量大的板块，避免造成外部用户短时间大量涌入的[「爆吧」现象](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%88%86%E5%90%A7)。\n### 10. 禁止主动参与仇恨社区\n不允许参与包括已被全站封禁的 chonglangTV 及其衍生的仇恨板块（actively engaged in hatred, harassment \u0026amp; ban evasion subreddits）。由于相关板块频繁违反全站内容规章和行为准则，干扰其他社区正常秩序，我们使用「机器人」自动程序禁止其活跃用户参与本板块。如果您认为机器人出错，或是误入上述板块，并无意继续参与此类仇恨团体，请[通过 ModMail 并附带相关链接和文字说明联络板务组](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/qyqk63/)进行核查。解封后，若再次参与仇恨社区，您的帐号将被重新封禁，且不再受理申请解封的申诉。\n### 11. 对具体事例的申述或报告须发 ModMail\n有明确反馈对象的问题（如「为何删帖」、「帖子未通过」、「封禁原因」等），请用 Report 或者 [ModMail 联系板务组](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/qyqk63/)。对板规或板块总体事务的讨论，可使用「板务」标签发帖。\n### 12. 遵守全站内容规章和行为准则\n除上述板规之外，应当同时遵守 [Reddit Content

Have a quick question about traveling in Japan? Want to share a tip or suggestion? Looking for broad recommendations? You've come to the right place! \n**Subreddit Rules** \n- **Japan Travel Tips is a place to ask questions and share advice about traveling in Japan.** Posts not on topic or only related to general travel topics will be removed. This includes questions about airlines, flights, passports/entry into Japan, living in the country, working in the country, etc. \n- **Posts must contain a title and body.** While we allow vague/broad questions in our subreddit, all posts must contain both a title and a body. We do not allow title-only posts. \n- **Fully researched and detailed itineraries should be posted in /r/JapanTravel.** If you have a fully researched and detailed itinerary (daily activities for each day) and are looking for a review, please post in /r/JapanTravel. /r/JapanTravelTips is for more general questions or bare-bones itinerary posts.\n- **We do not allow AMAs, self-published articles, vlogs, blogs, or any other kind of self-promotion in this sub, including esim codes.** /r/JapanTravelTips sources information from tourists, so users can receive information provided from the entire community. Our goal is to provide a platform for this information without having to click through to an article or a video. \n- **No AI-generated posts or comments allowed.** Posts or comments containing AI-generated itineraries, information, or content will be removed. Because AI-generated content is often wrong or misleading, the mods reserve the right to remove posts or comments that seem like they are AI-generated, even if not explicitly stated. Please contact the moderators if you feel the removal was in error.\n- **Standalone meet-up requests are not allowed in this subreddit.** Please post all meet-up inquiries in the stickied thread in /r/JapanTravel. \n- **Requests for assistance with bookings, ticket purchases, reservations, merchandise purchase requests, or other solicitation are prohibited.** We suggest going through official channels and reputable resale vendors for items or tickets you'd like to purchase. \n- **No meta posts about subreddit rules are allowed.** Please send a modmail to /r/JapanTravelTips with problems or suggestions. Do not PM individual mods. \n- **Be civil in posts and comments.** Harassment of other users or mods, trolling, posting of users' personal information, repeated intentional rule breaking, bullying, racism/discrimination, or other general unsavory behavior will be met with bans. \n- **This sub is PG-13, no exceptions.** We do not allow posts regarding illegal, questionable, or sexually explicit behavior, including posts about illegal drugs, underage alcohol consumption, adult/18+ activities, sexual services, or working illegally. \n- **No questions about visas/border policy allowed.** We do not allow questions about how to get a visa, how to properly fill out the information for a visa, or why visas were denied. Please seek advice directly from your local consulate. Additionally, we do not allow discussion of border policy.\n \nPosts may be removed/redirected at mod discretion.\n**Posting Advice** \n- Have a simple suggestion or tip that can make someone's Japan vacation easier? Feel free to post about what you learned while traveling in Japan. Consider including information such as: the exact location or nature of your recommendation, what you found interesting about it, or who this might appeal to. \n- Looking for recommendations? Use a broad, discussion-based question to get some information for your trip. For example: \"I'd like to check out some cafes in Tokyo, and I've seen a few neat places online but I want to know what you think. Has anyone tried [place], [other place], or [this place]? What else would you recommend?\" \n- Have a quick question you think the community can answer? Try to be as detailed as possible with your question, including relevant information about your trip such as time of year, length, and cities you're visiting. If you're asking about a specific establishment or sight, include when you're going and how you're getting there. If you are asking about a problem, include details of what happened and where. \n- Search and research before posting to avoid repetitive topics, if possible. Search in this subreddit, check /r/JapanTravel, or use the JapanTravel [wiki/FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/faqs/japantravel/) to see if your topic is commonly discussed before posting."},{"display_name":"math","description":"**Welcome to /r/math.**\n---\nThis subreddit is for discussion of mathematics.

Person must be a beggar, such as: \n* **Person seeking goods or services at a reduced cost, for free, or for a laughably lopsided trade**\n* **Person using social media, dating apps, or otherwise to seek out a specific type of relationship**\n 1. Person must be choosy, as in:\n* **Person must have unreasonable standards or have a comical sense of entitlement. Someone who is entitled but not choosy or begging is not a CB.**\n 1.

They got the beggar part down, but this sub is not /r/beggars so that post wouldn't fit. If that same person turns down someone offering to give them a ride to work because they don't want to be seen in a PT Cruiser, then that post would fit.\n* A parent asking for handouts because their kids want an Xbox for Christmas and the only way that could happen is if someone donates one, that isn't a choosingbeggar. That's someone begging, but without a sense of entitlement. If that person is offered a Nintendo and they scoff at the suggestion, then that would be a good post.\n**The person begging must be at least in the gradient of being an entitled jerk, this sub is not a place to mock poverty**\n***\n***\n**Be sure to check out our new sub for ChoosingBeggars memes and other stuff:**\n#/r/IndecentExposure\n***\n***\n***\n**Friends of the sub:**\n* /r/trashy \n* /r/CrackheadCraigslist \n* /r/dankmemes \n* /r/delusionalartists \n* /r/Justfuckmyshitup \n* /r/Badfaketexts \n* /r/TrumpRoasts\n* /r/iamverysmart \n* /r/insanepeoplefacebook \n* /r/indianpeoplefacebook \n* /r/BlackPeopleTwitter \n* /r/MurderedByWords \n* /r/ShittyGroupMembers"},{"display_name":"RandomThoughts","description":"A place to post random thoughts that leak out of your brain.\n** **\n**Rules**\n**1. Posts must be Random Thoughts.** Submissions must be in the format of a \"random thought\". We're NOT a venting/ranting/soapboxing/etc subreddit.\n**2. No hate speech, harassment or bullying.** \n- Hate speech will not be tolerated in any way. Hate speech is against Reddit's Content Policy.\n- The use of slurs or intentional aggressive/offensive interactions, racism, homo/transphobia and other forms of attacks on minority groups will result in a ban.\n- Arguing, harassment and bullying has no place on this subreddit, please report all instances so we can review/remove the submissions.\n**3. No taboo or immoral thoughts.** Topics that may fall under this rule may be, but are not restricted to; CSAM/Pedophillia, violence or harm towards others and admittance of a severe crime.\n- Encouraging topics that may fall under the bracket of taboo or illegal are forbidden here.\n- Bans in these instances are at the discretion of the moderators based on the severity of the infraction.\n**4. No posts about politics, religion, or gender.** \nPosts centered around politics, political stances, religion, and gender are extremely contentious topics on this subreddit and on Reddit. Due to previous incidences of hate speech, violence, threats, and bigotry, we no longer allow political, religious, or gender based posts.\nPolitical and gender posts lead to hate speech, bigotry, vicious arguing, white supremacy, racism, misogyny, misandry, and incel rhetoric.\nReligious posts lead to bigotry, bullying, and fear-mongoring.\n**5. Tag your NSFW submissions as NSFW and Report submissions not tagged.** For the sake of the minors of this subreddit who do not wish to see sexually explicit or generally NSFW content on their feeds, please do not post NSFW content here that is not tagged as such. Doing so opens a sexually explicit conversation with minors whether intentional or not and it is completely inappropriate. Not only this, but doing so also makes your post appear on the feeds of minors who have their 18+ filters on to keep NSFW content off their feeds.\n**6. Incels are not welcome here | Incel posts are not allowed.** \"Incels\" as a community have been dubbed as a terrorist group whos morals lie in bigotry, misogyny and violence. We have found that when incels make posts here, things turn vicious, hateful and concerning very quickly.\nWe class incels as a hate group and as such, all incel content falls under hate speech/immoral context and is not allowed here.\nPlease go to therapy.\n**7. Harassment in modmail or towards the moderators will not be tolerated.** Moderators are Reddit users who voluntarily take on the role of managing subreddits, we are under no obligation to take any of your shit. If you come tearing into modmail with aggression and hate, you'll either be met with the same energy or straight out muted and ignored completely.\n**8.

Vote and participate in the [new section](http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/new/?sort=new) and report rule violations.\n/r/Parenting is a subreddit for anything related to the controlled chaos we call parenting. \nDo you have a question for parents? Head over to /r/AskParents. \nDid your kid say something awesome? Join us at /r/thingsmykidsaid. \nAre you a caregiver or nanny? Check out /r/nanny. \nWe also recommend /r/relationships, /r/legaladvice and /r/family. \n#####Community Rules\n1. Only Parents or Guardians May Create New Posts\n * Parents/guardians are any person who has substantial decision-making authority in a child's life. However, it’s okay for anyone to comment, provided it’s on-topic and within rules. Indicate you're a parent or guardian, or self-select your user flair, to avoid confusion/accidental moderation. Non-parents/guardians that still have pressing questions for parents can utilize the weekly \"Ask Parents Anything\" thread in this sub or visit r/AskParents.\n1. Be Decent \u0026amp; Civil\n * Remember the Human! Disagree but remain respectful; don’t insult people or their children, name-call, or be intentionally rude. Bullying, including baiting/antagonizing, and brigading of either individual users or subreddits will not be tolerated. Reporting posts that violate this rule is the best way to get it noticed by the moderation team.\n1. No Medical \u0026amp; Legal Advice\n * Reddit and the internet, in general, are not the best places to get or give medical or legal advice. Support for established medical and legal situations is allowed. Do not ask about symptoms, post pictures, or ask if you should seek a medical professional. Do not ask if something is legal/illegal, if you should call the police, engage an attorney, or call child welfare agencies. Commenters should not offer medical or legal advice. Always consult a professional in these matters. Additionally, you may also consider posting on r/legaladvice for legal advice.\n1. No surveys, studies, or interviews\n * Absolutely no surveys, studies, petitions, interview requests or invitations to participate are permitted. This includes anything done for profit, academia, school, free, or for personal information. Please consider posting instead to r/samplesize.\n1. No linking, promotion, or advertising\n * We do not allow spam, self-promotion, marketing research, fundraising, petitions, solicitation of feedback, or any material that looks to use the community for benefit of themselves or anybody else. Non-promotional linking is also discouraged, especially if it's the main focus of the submission. This rule applies to both posts and comments.\n1. We are a discussion-first sub\n * This subreddit is discussion-based, and does not want blog posts, YouTube channels, open letters, pictures, or memes, or anything similar. This rule applies to posts and comments. Please check our [recommendation wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/wiki/other_subreddits) for other communities to post to.\n1. No Sexual Content Involving Minors\n * Most content describing sexual acts that involve minors (even when no adults are involved) will usually be removed. Self-exploration and sex can be a normal part of human growth and development. If you are worried your child is outside the range of normal please see a professional for advice. If you are worried about the sexual abuse of a minor please see your child's doctor, local police, or child welfare agency as soon as possible.\n1. General Posting and Moderation\n * Moderators can remove or approve any content at their discretion. If you feel something of yours was erroneously removed - reach out. We'd be glad to discuss it cordially. We only discuss moderation with the impacted user, not general curiosity seekers. Please help us by reporting posts and comments that don't meet the standard of our community for review! Your human moderators thank you for your patience and understanding.\n1. **Rule P** - No Photos of Children\n * Sometimes you want to post a picture of your little one, maybe to illustrate something that's happened to them, or to just share! We currently do not allow pictures of your little ones to be posted here, due to privacy and safety concerns. Please check out our [recommendation wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/wiki/other_subreddits) for other communities to post to instead!\n1. **Rule S** - Things My Kid Said Threads\n * We have the **\"Things My Kid Said\"** weekly thread about things your kids have said. Please consider saving your submission for this thread instead!\n#####The r/parenting Handbook:\n* **[Domestic Violence Resources](/r/Parenting/w/Parenting_Handbook/Domestic_Violence_Resources)**\n* **[Parenting Crisis Resources](/r/Parenting/w/Parenting_Handbook/Parenting_Crisis_Resources)**\n* [Early Parenting Resources](/r/Parenting/w/Parenting_Handbook/Early_Parenting_Resources)\n* [Education Years Parenting Resources](/r/Parenting/w/Parenting_Handbook/Education_Years_Parenting_Resources)\n* [Difficult Topics](/r/Parenting/w/Parenting_Handbook/Difficult_Topics)\n* [COVID-19 resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/wiki/new_corona_resources)\nCheck Out Our:\n* [Recommended Reading](/r/Parenting/w/Recommended_Reading)\n* [YouTube Recommendations!](http://redd.it/215grh)\n* Sister subreddit /r/kidsafevideos for youtube videos that are child appropriate!

Spoiler rules **do not** apply for the Naruto series. \n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;* Comments in threads that are already spoiler-marked do not need to be hidden in spoiler tags.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;* Use common courtesy and spoiler tag major events when referring to spoilers of other series, not necessarily limited to just manga/anime either.\n\u0026gt;---\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;##5\\. Limit low-effort submissions\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt; - Absolutely no memes, image macros, or shitposts are allowed. Use /r/dankruto. Any low-effort posts which do not even belong in dankruto shouldn't be posted at all.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;- Limit plain screenshots/gifs/caps of the manga/anime.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;- Posts should be directly related to Naruto.\n\u0026gt;---\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;##6\\. All Fanart, Fanedits, \u0026amp; Cosplays must be linked directly to the artist's page\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;- Quick sketches and works in progress are not allowed. Only thorough and complete works can be posted. However, one post can be made if you genuinely want to receive feedback.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;- Incorrectly sourced work will be removed. To link directly to the source, **copy-paste the url of the work into the url space that's available when making a link post.** Uploading said work as an image and leaving the link in the comment thread is the incorrect method. \n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;- If the art/edit/cosplay in question is original content (OC) re-hosting on Reddit/Imgur/etc is fine.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;- Use image searching tools to find the original artist: [Saucenao](http://saucenao.com) or [Google Images.](https://images.google.com/)\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;- Limit yourself to one fanart submission within approximately 24 hours.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;- Do not post art from the same user multiple days in a row. \n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;- If posting AI-generated art, be sure to specify in the title of your post that it is AI-created, and include the service used to generate it.\n\u0026gt;---\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;##7\\. Be mindful of our self-promotion policy\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;- Self-promotion should be thoughtful, limited, and consistently well received by the community. \n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;- The 9:1 ratio (ie. every one promotional post should be followed by approximately nine quality discussion threads) should be followed.\n\u0026gt;---\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;##8\\. VS. Battle \u0026amp; Crossover posts\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;- Simply posting a matchup in the title is not allowed, as not much effort is needed. Give an explanation in the text box or comments; talk about why you chose it, the conditions, who you think will win, etc.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;- Crossover battle posts with other series are not allowed. Power scaling across different series can be so different and difficult to compare that discussion gets messy. r/whowouldwin would be the better place for it.\n\u0026gt;---\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;##9\\. Support the creators and rights holders!\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;- /r/Naruto does not endorse any sort of third party that is profiting off of copyright infringement. Avoid linking to illegal third-party sites and encourage other users to search for legal alternatives for finding Naruto and Boruto content.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;- /r/Naruto is not a platform for selling/buying/promoting unlicensed merchandise and any links or mentions of said material will be removed unless they are being sold under a creative license.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;- Read Naruto and Boruto from [MangaPlus and Viz](https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_read_the_manga.3F)\n\u0026gt;---\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;##10\\. No NSFW Content\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;* This includes obvious fetish posts, sexually suggestive or provocative cosplays, actual nudity or hentai and so on. If you feel your post is a bit tame and doesn't violate this rule, you can post it but flair it as NSFW. Anything explicit however, use /r/cosplaygirls or some other NSFW subreddit.\n\u0026gt;---\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;##11\\. No Reposts\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;- Do not repost anything from the top 100 all-time or anything posted within the last 3 months.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;- Anything which has been posted before at least 5 times cannot be reposted\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;- Use the search bar, your search engine, and the FAQ to ensure that you are not reposting recent content or already answered questions.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;- Boruto episode previews and schedules should be posted once per month, and only if accompanied with a translation. Untranslated schedules/previews will be removed.\n\u0026gt;---\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;##12\\. No Naruto video game spam \n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;- Only news or official information related to the video game(s) are allowed.

Please be kind and courteous, friendly and professional\n[Be kind to your fellow human](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette). There’s no need to be mean or rude, keep unstructured critique to a minimum. When providing help, answer their question before making stylistic or tool suggestions.\n#### 2. Harassment will not be tolerated\nWe all started somewhere, and we're all allowed to be who we are. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, neurodivergence, race, ethnicity, physical attributes, religion, nationality, or other aspect of identity.\n#### 3. Avoid using an alias or display name that might be offensive\nreddit has a long history of intentionally offensive usernames, but not here. Names that detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all will be addressed.\n#### 4. Respect that people have differences of opinion\nEvery design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer, and there are valid reasons to choose between a range of tradeoffs between tools, approaches, and patterns.\n#### 5. Posts must conform to our guidelines\n**If you join this community to take value rather than contribute, the community will quickly react as though you are an intruder.** If you have a body of content you'd like to promote, our recommended way of doing so is to be an active and positive member of the subreddit.

Demo videos must be accompanied by source code, preferably in a runnable environment like Codepen, CodeSandbox, Replit, Glitch, etc.\n2. Please save portfolios for the weekly Sunday portfolio post.\n3. Posts should be original works. \n - Please do not dump raw AI output as a post or comment. If you share something from an AI, please also include which service it came from as well as an original thought, like why the response is trustworthy or details about how you prompted.\n4.

Personal attacks, insults, and bad faith criticism of users equipment or music will not be tolerated. Fair warning to all: racism, sexism, hate speech, political intolerance regardless of viewpoint (especially any witch-hunting or brigading), deadnaming, or harassment of any sort will result in an instant and permanent ban.\n2. **NO SALES POSTS** - Sale/trade/buy posts are not allowed. Please go to r/synths4sale instead. Links to uncommonly great specials/deals are allowed. If you are the manufacturer or developer of a commercial product, please message the mods before posting, but we will usually allow new product promotion as long as you stay to answer questions.\n3. **ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR OWN CONTENT** - Links to streams of your music are allowed only if you intend on fielding questions about your production and your use of synthesizers in your music. If you are not willing to field questions then your post will be removed.\n4. **NO LOW-EFFORT CONTENT** - Low-effort content includes: memes, jokes, pictures of boxes/receipts/shipping notifications, pictures of gear without explanation, self-promotion without participation, etc. Posts violating the spirit of this rule may be removed at the moderators discretion.\n5. **LEAVE A COMMENT ON LINK/PHOTO/VIDEO POSTS** - Link, photo, and video posts must include a meaningful comment by the OP. “Here is a track I made” or \"look at my new synth\" is not sufficient since the point is to encourage discussion. Posts lacking a comment will be automatically removed after 1 hour.\n6. **NO PRICE SHAMING** - Some equipment doesn’t cost much, some costs a lot. That is ok. Posts that contain insults, attacks, or conspiracy theories based on your opinion of the value of gear will be deleted.\n7. **NO PIRACY** - This is an instant ban. If you use our community to encourage any sort of IP theft you will be banned, no questions asked. Support the people that make all of this possible.\n8. **APPROACH CONTROVERSIAL TOPICS WITH CARE** - Discussion posts that are inflammatory, aggressive, or otherwise likely to provoke flame wars, intentionally or not, will be removed at the moderators’ discretion.

Certain questions, such as \"how do I become a pilot\" and the like have been asked repeatedly in the past.**\n2. Keep it relevant to pilots. r/flying is intended to be a place to discuss things like pilot training, regulations, procedures, techniques, aircraft ownership and maintenance, piloting as a career, and similar topics. “Aviation enthusiast” content is better suited to r/aviation. Flight simulation belongs in r/flightsim. Questions and content about air travel (passenger experience, frequent flyer programs, etc.) are better suited to r/travel.\n3. Post something that you would like to discuss! **If posting only a photo, video, or link, you must include a relevant top-level comment to start conversation**. A direct question in the title will suffice, otherwise you must add a comment! Further, **self-promotion of social media accounts or blogs is not allowed outside of an officially designated self-promotion post**. See [this FAQ page](/r/flying/wiki/sub_rules#wiki_rule_3) for more details on what’s allowed and how to make sure your post complies with this rule. \n4. PLEASE no memes. /r/flying is a meme-free zone.\n5. Cite sources when appropriate. If you want to run an academic survey here message the mods first. No commercial surveys are allowed.\n6. \\[Reserved\\]\n7. Be excellent to each other. /r/flying is intended to be a friendly and accepting place; check your ego at the door and take your snark and attitude elsewhere. \n8. We strive to keep /r/flying as commercial-free as possible. If you are about to post something that involves the exchange of goods or services for money, run it by the mods first. This includes requests for donations. If you want to sell an aviation-related item or aircraft, post it in /r/TheHangar.\n9.

No memes, low effort posts, reposts or crossposts from /r/all. If it is appropriate for /r/AdviceAnimals or any other meme or image macro subreddit, it is not appropriate for /r/army. Consider /r/armycirclejerk or /r/justbootthings instead. | \n• (3) This is not a pro-military circlejerk, but please have some sources to base the more controversial topics on. | \n• (4) Use the search bar. It is very likely that whatever you are about to post has already been posted before. **This includes questions about duty stations, MOSs, boots, or what to take to the field.** | \n• (5) We don't all know what a 12V or a 35Q or a 94L is. Post the description along with your obscure MOS code. | \n• (6) Please keep your flair text rank or duty-related. The purpose of flair is so we know you have a background in a particular subject matter. Moderators reserve the right to change flair at will. | \n• (7) Source your posts well. No rumors, PNN or unfounded speculation. Links from USAWTFM, ASMDSS and similar at moderator discretion. No Stolen Valor.|\n• (8) N00b / Joining questions go in the Weekly Question Thread (or Recruiter Thread) stickied at the top, in the black-on-gold link at the top, and in the sidebar. Do not answer n00b questions on the main boards.

[Please see here for our stale topics.](/r/popheads/wiki/index/stale-topics#st) Certain [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/stale-topics#wiki_banned_comments) are also banned to increase the quality of discussion. Stale topics are constantly changing, and it is ultimately up to the discretion of the moderators whether a topic is stale or not.\nLow effort discussions | Discussion posts should try to foster discussion, the body of the text post must encourage discussion or offer the original poster's thoughts. Comments must also explain their answers. Any discussion posts that ask for recommendations, help to make a playlist, or only ask for people to name songs/albums/artists that fit a certain criteria **without explanation/justification** will be redirected to the Daily Discussion thread.\nNon-newsworthy posts | Please only submit pop music news-related articles, videos, images or links that are topical and noteworthy. Though posts such as articles, videos, links or pictures consisting of non-newsworthy content will be removed, they are always welcome to be posted in Daily Discussion Threads. Please do not editorialize article or interview titles except for cases of major announcements. [Guidelines for teasers and Instagram posts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/#wiki_rules_and_guidelines)\nFollow reddit rules/reddiquette | This is a given.\nTabloid material | This subreddit forbids tabloid material that focuses on non-newsworthy drama, sensationalist content, and/or dubious sources. In order for gossip to be considered newsworthy, it must either be reported on by a major, reliable news source or have been addressed by the artist in question. Please redirect your content to the daily gossip megathread, Teatime \u0026amp; Trending Topics.\nNo Spam | Any self-promotional posts should be from established members of the community. We take this very seriously, and any spam is unacceptable and will be removed. Users must have at least 10 posts/comments spread out over a few months on the subreddit to self-promote.\nRecent songs only | Only songs \u0026amp; videos released within the last 30 days can be posted. The sub only allows FRESH music after it has been officially released in the UK. This mainly refers to Friday releases; other posts are generally released worldwide. Always remember to use the 'Artist - Song' title format. Music videos are only allowed on or after the advertised YouTube premiere time. Each user can only submit a maximum of 3 FRESH posts per 24 hours, with a minimum of 10 minute intervals between each submission.\nKeep things civil | Please do not come here for the sole reason of harassment/flaming. Keep things civil. Use of discriminatory language isn't appreciated. Posts that appear to be baiting arguments will be removed. Attacking other users will warrant a ban. Please keep negative \"stan-twitter\"-isms on stan twitter.\nNo illegal media|Do not post illegal streams or downloads of songs/albums. Asking for or posting instructions on how you can get it is also not allowed. These are banned on reddit sitewide, and sharing such material endangers our whole community. If it was an honest mistake, please message us; we'll try to be as lenient as possible. Video clip posts from unofficial sources will be removed as well.\nPop music?|We are purposely vague on what we consider pop, because it's a difficult genre to define. Usually we'll try to focus on more mainstream pop, but **pop-adjacent artists are allowed**. In general, the mods trust you all to post relevant music. Music will generally not be removed by a moderator unless it is deemed shitposty or too irrelevant to the subreddit. This rule is subject to moderator discretion, but **if you feel a removed post was relevant please notify us**!\nFlairing Posts | Flairs are NOT manually typed in the thread title – please select the flair either during or after submitting by clicking on the flair button that looks like a little dog tag and choosing the adequate option.\nReposts|Please check the subreddit for articles and streams that have been posted already.\nNo Queue Flooding | Users can only submit a maximum of 3 posts per 24 hours, with a minimum of 10 minute intervals between each post submission. This rule applies to all post flairs.\nTeatime threads should exclusively have tea | Teatime threads should only have news or your reaction to news. You not liking the last New Music that dropped isn't tea and belongs in the Daily Discussion Threads.\nLeak Threads | Leak threads are to be contained in the Daily Discussion and Teatime \u0026amp; Trending Topics threads and are not allowed as its own post. Posting a link to a leak results into a temporary ban.\n---\n[](/monthly-release-calendar)\n---\n#Use the tags:\n* **FRESH**: New songs released in the last 30 days. If an album or song is region locked (meaning that it isn't available until Midnight in your region), please wait until after it's been released **in the UK** (which typically is Midnight GMT (UTC+0) but Midnight BST (UTC+1) during Daylight Savings) to post it. Each user may only post multiple [FRESH] streams 10 minutes apart. \n* **FRESH ALBUM**: Same rules as [FRESH] apply, but this is to be used for albums and mixtapes. The 10 minute rule applies too.\n* **FRESH EP**: Same as above but with EPs. \n* **FRESH VIDEO**: Newly released music videos.\n* **PERFORMANCE**: New live performances from recent awards/TV shows. Only official sources are allowed, i.e. the official YouTube channel of the award/TV show, so **no fan footage**. \n* **NEWS**: Newly released info by **official** artist sources or news publications.\n* **ARTICLE**: Non-news related links, such as interviews, reviews, or other write-ups. Videos will be included under this until we figure out something that isn't useless.\n* **DISCUSSION**: Thought-provoking posts that start discussions. Please write something in the textbox to kick off the discussion (e.g. suggesting examples or providing your own opinion), don't just pose a question. This is **not for links.**\n* **LEAK**: Thread announcing that a project has leaked. Discussing the leaks is fine, but **no links**. Illegal links are banned sitewide on reddit. \n* **ORIGINAL**: Links to your own material that you'd like to share with the subreddit. Only OC from regular members will be allowed.\n* **SERIOUS**: For any content with sensitive subject matter. No joking or memes allowed in the comments.\nSpecial flairs:\n* **WEEKLY**: Only to be used on mod-approved weekly threads. See the thread schedule.\n* **ANNOUNCEMENT**: Official statements from the moderators.\n* **RATE** and **RATE REVEAL**: Threads for the monthly rates, posted by the hosts.\n* **MEGATHREAD**: All-encompassing threads accommodating important/notable releases or events. If you would like to create a megathread please ask through modmail.\n* **GAME**: Informal, fun threads. *Please ask the moderators through modmail for permission to host these*.\n* #### Tags are **NOT** manually typed in the thread title – please select the flair after submitting by clicking on the 'flair' button and choosing the adequate option\n---\n#[Thank you to our donors!](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/charitydrive2019)\n[Thank you so much!](https://redd.it/etzwxg)\n---\n#Best of the Year Results\n**Songs**: ['15](https://redd.it/clx4xh) (*) / ['16](https://redd.it/5jm2me) / ['17](https://redd.it/7oe97v/) / ['18](https://redd.it/afd090/) / ['19](https://redd.it/etwkpe/) / ['20](https://redd.it/kyrcji) / ['21](https://redd.it.com/slgv0x) / ['22](https://redd.it/14h854i)\n**Albums**: ['18](https://redd.it/aa23t6) / ['19](https://redd.it/ewcra1) / ['20](https://redd.it/l2rvtx)\n\\* retrospective\n---\n#Thread Schedule:\n*Daily*: [Daily Discussion](https://tinyurl.com/vardgcy), [Teatime \u0026amp; Trending Topics](https://bit.ly/3DITxSc)\n*Monday*: [Popheads Weekly Hot 50 Chart](https://goo.gl/Do7myj)\n*Tuesday*: [Weekly Hot 100 and Other Charts Discussion](https://bit.ly/3BBi49V)\n*Monthly*: [Town Hall](https://bit.ly/3mZULCK), [Whose Line Is It Anyway](https://goo.gl/7xrHl0), [Monthly Self Promo Day](https://bit.ly/3h0UmMi)\n*Quarterly*: [Best of r/popheads](https://bit.ly/3BEJDPw)\n*Regular*: [Artist Rankings](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/search?q=Hello+popheads+author%3Aradiofan15\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n---\n#Other Communities\n[**Click here to see other relevant communities to /r/popheads!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/other-communities)\n---\n#Social Media Team:\n* /u/badgyalrierie\n* /u/ImADudeDuh\n* /u/outsideeyess\n* /u/pierce_newton\n* /u/poppinmmolly\n---\n[](https://redd.it/tyoekq)\n---\n#####[AMAs](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/amas) | [Rates](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-threads#wiki_rates) | [Popheads Charts](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/charts) | [Jukebox](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/popheadsjukebox) | [Top Ten Pop Ten](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/top-ten-pop-ten) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/popheads)"},{"display_name":"yugioh","description":"\u0026gt;\n* **[STATE OF THE SUB (1/5)](/search?q=subreddit%3Ayugioh+title%3AState%2Bof%2Bthe%2BSub\u0026amp;restrict_sr=\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)**\n* **[OTHER MODPOSTS (12/25)](/search?q=subreddit%3Ayugioh+title%3AMODPOST\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=off\u0026amp;t=all)**\n* **Yu-Gi-Oh!

No NSFW Submissions.\n[Reddit's rules](https://www.reddit.com/rules)\n[Reddit user agreement](https://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement)\n[Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)\nAbiding by the first two is standard no matter where you post on this site, but in this community there is an expectation of practicing good reddiquette when you can. This includes your comments, submissions, and any other communication or activity on this subreddit. Also do not post NSFW content or illegal content.\n### Rule 2: Posts must discuss a topic. Write at least a few sentences. Exceptions for news and art.\nPosts must discuss a topic. Put in the effort to write at least a few sentences talking about it. You can't just bring something up for others to discuss without discussing the topic first yourself. The exception is when you share content which is worthwhile in its own right, such as news, or art. \nExamples which are NOT allowed, without additional discussion:\n- \"What do you think about X?\" \n- \"What's your favourite X?\" \n- Duel Screenshots \n- Anime/Manga Screenshots\n### Rule 3: Use the \"Q\u0026amp;A and Ruling Megathread\" to ask for information. Use /r/Yugioh101 if you're new.\nIf you have a question which is asking for some information, instead of starting a discussion about a topic, don't post it here. Instead, please ask in the \"Q\u0026amp;A and Ruling Megathread\". It's the post pinned at the top of /r/Yugioh. We also have /r/Yugioh101. It is a subreddit for helping new and returning players. If you are a new player asking for advice, we recommend you post there instead.\n### Rule 4: No buying, selling, asking about prices or grading.\nYou cannot ask about what items are worth. You cannot ask if cards are worth grading, or what grade they would get. You cannot buy, sell, or trade. It is okay to discuss the economy of the game. You can discuss price trends, etc. For checking prices, use sites like TCGplayer, Cardmarket, or ebay. For niche items, you might not be able to find prices on these sites, but we still don't allow posts for asking about them. For buying, selling, or trading, use /r/YGOMarketplace.\n### Rule 5. For \"Deck List Help\" posts, all card names must be legible. The title must say what your Deck is.\nWhen posting your Deck List, you must make sure all card names are comfortably readable. We recommend using a site like [YGOPRODECK](https://ygoprodeck.com/deckbuilder/) to share the Deck List. You can use a screenshot of your Deck, but the image resolution must be good enough that the card names can be read. You cannot rely on people recognizing the cards from the images alone. Your post's title must make it clear which deck you're playing.\n### Rule 6: For art or news, include a link to the source. Do not post false or misleading information. \nIf you're posting your own art, your post much say that it's yours. For example: \"Kaiba artwork I made\". If you're posting someone else's art, or news, your post must include a link to the source. Make sure that any information you post is correct. Make sure that it is not presented in a misleading way.\n### Rule 7: Don't advertise without participating first. 90% of your activity must be unrelated to your content.\n90% of your activity on this subreddit must be unrelated to advertising your content. For example, if you want to post one of your YouTube videos, you should participate in the comments of other posts first. Engage in genuine discussions with people. If you think you have something important to advertise, [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/yugioh) first to ask if we can make exception.\n### Rule 8: For Custom Cards, the text must be written how real cards are. The title must say that it's Custom.\nThe exact phrasing you use in card text is important. Look at recent cards with similar effects to yours. Read these to learn how card text is written: [Problem Solving Card Text](https://yugiohblog.konami.com/articles/?tag=problem-solving-card-text) and [Lantern's Custom Card Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tS11H_Oa7jdiQVOgV03sjh3uvk3YGYIbrNIG2b-C0vY/edit?usp=sharing). Your title must make it clear that this is not a real card. Include a link to the source for artwork used.\n### Rule 9: No posts just for showing off cards or other items. You can use /r/YugiohShowcase instead.\nDo not make posts which are just for showing off pictures of cards, or other items like boxes, packs, or action figures. Please use /r/YugiohShowcase instead.\n### Rule 10: No memes, repetitive posts, or off-topic posts.\nWe don't allow memes. You can post in /r/YugiohMemes instead. \nWe don't allow multiple posts about the same topic within a short space of time. If there has recently been another post about the same topic, you should comment in that one instead of making a new post.\nPosts must be about Yu-Gi-Oh!\n##[Weekly Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/wiki/weekly_thread_index)\nThread | Schedule\n:--|:--\n**[Q\u0026amp;A and Ruling Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=subreddit%3A%22yugioh%22+author%3AAutoModerator+Q%26A+and+Ruling+Megathread\u0026amp;restrict_sr=\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=week)** | Monday, pinned all week\n[**Banlist Prediction Thread**](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=subreddit%3A%22yugioh%22+title%3A%22Banlist+Prediction+Thread%22\u0026amp;restrict_sr=\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=week) | Wednesday\n**[Vent Thread](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=subreddit%3A%22yugioh%22+title%3A%22Friday+Vent+Thread%22\u0026amp;restrict_sr=\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=week)**| Friday \n**[Yu-Gi-Oh!

Alas, winners rotate. So, here goes:\nStart by reading about [three-fund portfolios](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio), consider the [diversification benefits of ex-US holdings](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Domestic/International), and for a simple [graphical demonstration](https://web.archive.org/web/20210109000118/https://vanguardblog.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/02/blog_global_equity_investing_1.png) of [rotating winners](https://web.archive.org/web/20220110224018/https://movement.capital/summarizing-the-case-for-international-stocks/), [check out this chart](https://www.callan.com/periodic-table/). The bottom line is this: [global equity investments increase diversification](https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/research/pdf/Global-equity-investing-The-benefits-of-diversification-and-sizing-your-allocation-US-ISGGEB_042021_Online.pdf) and as of the time of this sidebar update, [international stocks](https://web.archive.org/web/20200313134254/https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/investing-ideas/international-investing-myths) are relatively inexpensive compared to US ones.\n*Be extremely wary* of buying high into only 'hot' sectors, which can lead to selling low if those cool off. If you're at a loss for where to begin, start with a [Target Date](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/target-retirement/#/) fund and learn the [basics of investing](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Books:_recommendations_and_reviews#Start-up_books) before you start tilting away from a broadly diversified global portfolio.\nWe've all been where you are - the appeal of recent outperformers is extremely tempting. But if you had invested in the *best performing markets and sectors* during the 2000s, you'd have had a rough time during the 2010s. No one knows what the future holds, but avoid learning the hard way by diversifying.

All rules will be applied regardless of the number upvotes a post/comment has.\n* **No support requests** - This is not a support forum! Head to /r/linuxquestions or /r/linux4noobs for support or help. Looking for a distro? Try r/findmeadistro.\n* **No spamblog submissions** - Posts should be submitted using the original source with the original title. Posts that are identified as either blog-spam, a link aggregator, or an otherwise low-effort website are to be removed. Some reasons for removal are that they contain re-hosted content, usually paired with privacy-invading ads. If there's another discussion on the topic, the link is welcome to be submitted as a top level comment to aid the previous discussion. Please see: r/linux/wiki/rules/banneddomains\n* **No memes, image macros, rage comics, overdone jokes** - Meme posts of any kind are not allowed in r/linux. Feel free to post over at /r/linuxmemes instead. This rule can also apply to comments, including overdone jokes, comment-chain jokes, or other redditisms that are popular elsewhere.\n* **Reddiquette, trolling, or poor discussion** - r/linux asks all users follow [Reddiquette.](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) Reddiquette is ever changing, so a revisit once in awhile is recommended. Top violations of this rule are trolling, starting a flamewar, or not \"Remembering the human\" aka being hostile or incredibly impolite. Additionally, sexism/racism/other isms are not allowed. See also: /r/linux/wiki/rules/userconduct\n* **Relevance to r/linux community / Promoting closed source applications over FOSS** - Posts should follow what the community likes: GNU, Linux kernel, developers of open source software, or other applications on Linux. Take some time to get the feel of the subreddit if you're not sure!\n* **Spamming self-promotion, surveys, crowdfunding** - Submitting your own original content is welcome on r/linux, but we do ask that you contribute more than just your own content to the subreddit as well as require you to interact with the comments of your submission. We set that no more than 10% of your posts should be your content. Please be aware that this does not supersede other rules. Additionally, surveys for your blog/news source/paper/own use are not allowed. Please see /r/linux/wiki/rules/crowdfunding for those crowdfunding..\n* **No misdirecting links, sites that require a login, or URL shorteners** - In short: if your link doesn't go right to the content it will be removed. Sites that require a login to view the content are not allowed in r/linux. Example: A private Facebook post or a news organization that doesn't have free article views. URL shorteners and links that misdirect users to ads/jokes are also banned. See a list here, although the mods will make a decision on a per domain basis as needed: /r/linux/wiki/rules/banneddomains\n* **No NSFW** - No NSFW links or images without mod approval. No discussion that is overly-suggestive to what is normally considered NSFW.\n* **Non-useful Image Upload/Fluff Image** - Images of \"Linux in the wild\", plushies, Tux, and more are not encouraged for posting as a top level submission. If necessary, this can apply to comments too at mod discretion. The image/video upload feature is for posts regarding features/guides/etc. See also: Meme rule.\nSee even more subreddit and external links over at [the supplemental page](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/wiki/sidebar/supplemental)\nThis subreddit is fan ran and not affiliated with any organization."},{"display_name":"furry_irl","description":"---\n####[**Click here to view our full rules on the wiki**](https://www.reddit.com/r/furry_irl/wiki/rules)\n---\n###Posting requirements\n* You need to be at least 3 days old to post a submission or comment.\n* You need at least 20 karma before you can post a submission. You can still comment on the sub to get that 20 karma!\n###If you’re a content creator\n* And found your work posted here without your permission, please [contact us](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/furry_irl), so we can help you remove it. \n* Reddit is a public forum; the moderation team can’t keep an eye on every piece of artwork posted to ensure they have gotten proper permission from the artists to be rehosted and modified. We rely on user reports and feedback from artists to enforce this.\n###If you want to do a promotion in the subreddit\n* Please [contact us](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/furry_irl), so we can discuss the best way to do it per the Reddit sitewide and subreddit rules. \n* Please note that the Reddit sitewide [guidelines on self-promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) still apply.\n___\n# Rules\n### 1. Furry_irl is a subreddit for furry memes\n* All submissions must be memes about furries or furry culture in a humorous or relatable way. Posts need to stand on their own; if the fact they are being posted to a furry subreddit is what makes them ‘furry’, then it’s not content suitable for this subreddit.\n### 2. All posts must be titled “furry_irl”\n* Submissions must have the title “furry_irl” (case-insensitive, you can use mixed capitalisation, lowercase or all lowercase, it doesn’t matter). The underscore _ can be replaced with any symbol, or even an emoji! (e.g. furry🐾irl)\n### 3. Furry_irl is a SFW community\n* Explicit adult content and/or imagery is not allowed. This community is for all furries, regardless of age, and we strive to make this subreddit a welcoming place for all members to submit and view content without concerns. Suggestive content needs to be tagged NSFW.\n* If you want to submit or see NSFW furry memes, check out r/yiff_irl!\n### 4. Direct image/video/GIF links only. Posted videos must be no longer than 2 minutes\n* Because this is primarily an image browsing content subreddit, links to websites (even elsewhere on Reddit) will be removed. Please only post links to images, GIFs and videos. Use timestamps to skip ahead in a video to only share the relevant part.\n### 5. Don't spam; submit quality, not quantity\n* Please make sure that you allow at least 10 minutes to pass between each submission, and submit no more than 3 within a 24-hour period. This is so that other Redditors have the opportunity to submit content and have it visible to r/furry_irl users.\n### 6. AI generated artworks are not allowed\n* Posts that contain AI generated artwork as a centerpiece or otherwise prominent part of its composition will be subject to removal.\n### 7. No threats or advocating violence\n* Do not threaten, advocate for, or celebrate, violence, harm (physical or otherwise), or the death of others. This rule applies to everyone.\n### 8. No personal attacks, doxxing, etc\n* Name-calling, ad-hominem, demeaning, inflammatory, or other uncivil comments directed at other users are not allowed. Public accusations (i.e. “call-outs” and “drama”) are not okay. Users are not allowed to post personal or identifying information of others for any reason.\n### 9. Hate speech and discriminatory language are not tolerated\n* Posts and comments using words or phrases that may be harmful are subject to removal, including but not limited to racist, sexist, ableist, homophobic or transphobic slurs.

If you mark your post as solved, please also post the solution if it is not already in the comments. Mods may add flairs when they have time. Please be considerate to the mods and the helpers and add your unsolved flair, and **change it to solved when your question has been answered.**\n********\n**Rules:**\n1) Try by yourself first!\nTry to find a solution by looking it up online – most issues can be resolved this way!\nDoing your own research will save everyone time, and help you learn faster!\n2) Be as detailed as possible\nDescribe your goals in detail. Explain what you've already tried and what went wrong. Add reference images if needed. Try adding a link to file so helpers can investigate issues you wouldn't know to. If you link a video, provide a time stamp.\nSummarize your problem in the title, but add additional details-- text, images, links-- in the post body or in comments. Don't just write \"Help!\"\nIf images can help explain your problem, use clear, uncropped screenshots, not phone photos.\n3) Let us know when you've solved it!\nWhen you have figured out the solution, please mention it in the comments if it is not already there.\nAlso, apply the \"Solved\" flair so others know that the problem is resolved!\n4) No artwork, tutorials, and feedback requests\nDon't post finished art or tutorials. This includes vague requests like \"What can I improve?\" All posts must be focused on a specific problem you've encountered.\nIf you need to include someone else's art as a reference, add it as a link rather than an image in your top level post.\nFeedback requests and tutorials should be posted to r/blender instead.\n5) No bug reports\nIf you are sure you are doing everything correctly, but Blender is crashing, freezing, corrupting your files, etc – this is a bug. Make sure you are running the latest version - it might have the fix!\nIf the bug persists and you can reliably reproduce it, check out [this guide](https://blender.stackexchange.com/a/1378) for reporting bugs. By making a detailed report, you can help the Blender team identify and fix the bug! Posting your complaint on Reddit is unlikely to get help.\n6) Be nice\nPlease be respectful that everyone has a different level of Blender experience, and all Blender users are welcome to post here.\nIf the community is helping you, try helping others too! The best way is to browse the \"New\" posts for unanswered questions and see if you can help.\nDo not make mean comments or give unsolicited harsh criticism. Use the least inflammatory language you can to express your point.\nNo ALL CAPS titles. No question spam.\n*********\n**Other places to ask**\n[Blender Stack Exchange] (https://blender.stackexchange.com/)\n[BlenderArtists] (https://blenderartists.org/c/support)\nAnd don't forget the [Blender manual] (https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/index.html) itself.\nIf you ask multiple places, think about providing links to the various places the questions are asked. Seeing how others reason about the problem can be useful for helpers, and it will certainly be useful to those searching for the solution in the future.\n**How to add detail**\nTo take an uncropped screen capture of your active Blender window in Windows, hit alt + print screen. You can paste this image directly into many image hosts like [Imgur] (https://imgur.com/).\nReddit doesn't host arbitrary files (like a .blend) itself, and most users will not want to share their email address for attachments. You can host a file using a variety of file sharing services, such as [Dropbox] (https://dropbox.com), [Google Drive] (https://www.google.com/drive/), [Mega] (https://mega.nz/), or [WeTransfer] (https://wetransfer.com). Helpers will want the .blend file, not the .blend1 or .blend2 or any other automatic backups.\nIf your file is large, try enabling \"compression\" on the sidebar in the file save dialog. If helpers will need images, [pack external data] (https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/files/blend/packed_data.html) into the file. If they won't, unpack all external data to save space!\nConsider making a simplified version of the problem for a linked file. This is an essential first step in troubleshooting most problems anyways, and will save your helpers time and bandwidth.\nIf you can't share the file because of commercial concerns, then consider recreating the problem in a different context, without any \"trade secrets\".\n**Related Subreddits**\n[r/blender](http://www.reddit.com/r/blender)\n*********\n**Subreddit under construction, and new moderation.**\nThanks to /u/flargus for starting this sub.\nThanks to /u/Gazpachian for the header!"},{"display_name":"kansascity","description":"#####[Welcome to /r/KansasCity.

Frugality is unique to the individual. It does not refer to the final cost, value, quality, or popularity of the item.\nViolations of this rule are an automatic 7 day ban.\n######**2.Questions/Single-use codes**\n* To encourage the sharing of deals and sales, we limit the number of posts that aren't directly related to a sale or deal. \n[Click here to visit the Simple Questions and One-Time Use code sticky.](https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/about/sticky?num=2)\n[Click here to visit the Buy/Sell/Trade sticky.](https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/about/sticky?num=1)\nViolations of this rule are an **automatic 1 day ban**. \n######**3.No Referral Links/Codes**\n* While we encourage sharing of discount codes and unique links to awesome deals, we discourage users from sharing their own referral links and codes for which they profit from. This removes the incentive of profit for redditors who post and comment within r/frugalmalefashion and keeps the community fair, honest, and ethical. \nWhen money is involved, you cannot trust anyone to be objective, particularly on the internet.\nViolations of this rule are an **automatic 1 day to permanent ban.**\n######**4.No misleading links** \n* Do not spam or mislead users. This includes coercion with deceiving links and fake websites.\n######**5.Follow Reddiquette** \n* We strictly enforce reddiquette in r/frugalmalefashion. [Click here to visit the official Reddiquette page](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). Healthy debate and sharing of information requires a civil environment, so consider the following:\n- Remember the human.\n- Adhere to the same standards of behavior online that you follow in real life.\n- Use an \"innocent until proven guilty\" mentality.\n- State your reason for any editing of posts.\n######**6.No astroturfing** \n* Astroturfing is the practice of masking the sponsors of a message or organization to make it appear as though it originates from and is supported by grassroots participants.\nTo maintain honest and fair posts, do not pose as a third party to a company or a deal/sale if you are directly or indirectly affiliated with a company.\nIf you are directly affiliated, such as an employee, shareholder, owner, or related to any of the above, you must disclose it.\n######**7.New Accounts \u0026amp; Karma** \n* For new users, we require a certain minimum amount of karma before posting new threads. By doing so, we are able to filter out a large number of spam posts from bots to spam-filled websites.\nIf you believe your post is legitimate yet still removed, the moderators will review the post, potentially allow it, and monitor it for suspicious activity.\n######**8.No company posts** \n* Posting as a company, even if you announce it, will result in a **permanent ban as that is considered spam.**\nSimilar to the rules on astroturfing and referral links, we strictly enforce a non-biased and ethical subreddit, where money isn't exchanged to our subreddit or our members.\n######**9.Title must include discount** \n* To improve the ability to scroll and quickly read deals, we ask that redditors include this information in their post title if possible or applicable.\n######**10.No previously posted sales** \n* To cut back on multiple posts sharing the same information, we require posts to only contain new information on deals.\nYou may create a new post for the following:\n- New items added to a previously posted deal.\n- More percentage off to a previously posted deal.\nTypically, sales run 3-7 days but can run as long as 2 weeks, so please check the post history that far to see if your deal has been posted already.\n######**11.No insignifcant deals/sales**\n* In order to keep posts relevant to as many redditors as possible, and to keep our subreddit clean from spam, we don't allow insignificant deals. Typically, we consider insignificant deals to be those which are a very low discount (like perpetual discounts, or rolling sales) or items which aren't historically very popular. \n######**12.YMMV Posts**\n* Some deals are only available at specific physical locations, or have very limited stock, e.g. returned items or factory seconds. In this case, use the YMMV flair (\"Your Mileage May Vary\") to indicate that others may not be able to obtain the same deal.\n**YMMV posts must include location and other pertinent details in the title, or they will be removed.**\n######**13.NSFW Content**\n* Since a large number of our subscribers view these deals either around friends/family and at work or school, we can't allow NSFW content, and if it is shared, it must be disclosed.\nTypically, we won't allow this type of content if it's purely NSFW in nature, rather than just happening to be NSFW and related to a deal or sale (such as with underwear).\nThis is a bannable offense and we do enforce it.\n######**Ban List**\n* Frugality complaint rule violations: usually 7 days.\n* Spam: 1-30 days, depending on the type/severity.\n* Personal attacks: varies by severity. Usually ~10 days.\n* Referral codes/affiliate links: 30 days.\n* Astroturfing/vote manipulation: usually permanent"},{"display_name":"alberta","description":"#### [Mod Applications](https://old.reddit.com/r/alberta/wiki/modding)\n#### [Find us on Twitter!](https://twitter.com/AlbertaReddit)\n#### [View all r/Alberta Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Alberta/comments)\n#### [r/Alberta sans Politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/alberta/search?q=flair%3A%27General%27+OR+flair%3A%27News%27+OR+flair%3A%27Environmental%27+OR+flair%3A%27Question%27+OR+flair%3A%27Request%27+OR+flair%3A%27Discussion%27+OR+flair%3A%27Opinion%27\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on)\n[](http://alberta.ca)\n###Welcome to Alberta!###\n* http://alberta.ca\n* http://travelalberta.com\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta\n###Rules\n#### [Community Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/alberta/wiki/index)\n* Please click the link above for the complete list of community rules. The following list is a summary:\n-\n1. **Remain civil.** It is important that we maintain a civil atmosphere in our subreddit to ensure a positive environment for everyone to contribute in. Treat other users decently as you would treat people in person. This includes not engaging in personal attacks, generalizations about a population, hate-speech, flaming, baiting, trolling, witch-hunting, or unsubstantiated accusations. Report problem posts but especially do not engage in like behaviour.\n2. **No discrimination, period.** Racism and other forms of discrimination will not be tolerated. Such comments will be removed at mod discretion and you may be banned. Please report content you see that violates this.\n3. **Trolling, harassment, sea-lioning, brigading, derailing, and doxxing.** This behaviour sows resentment, paranoia and discord in a community and is not allowed. It is not civil and may result in a permanent ban from this subreddit. In certain cases, we may contact site admins about it as well. Determining what qualifies as trolling etc. can be nuanced and is up the discretion of the moderator team.\n4. **Social media.** Social media posts, such as X/Twitter or Facebook are not allowed. This includes screenshots. You may [apply for an exemption](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/alberta) if it's an Emergency Alert or other urgent matter. Otherwise, all social media posts will be removed.\n5. **News articles.** You must use the original headline as the title and provide a direct link to the source (not a text submission). Screenshots are not allowed.\n6. **Submitting multiple articles without commenting.** If you submit multiple articles or stories please also leave a comment with your submissions to help start the discussion and share your point of view or thoughts. /r/Alberta is for everyone, not just carpet bombing with a single view point or agenda. Share, discuss!\n7. **Duplicate posts.** The first submitted news article is the one we'll keep, duplicates are removed.\n8. **Low content posts.** Posts that qualify as \"low content\" can include things like AI generated image/text, advertisements, infographics, pictures of headlines, or pictures of politicians with a quote overlaid, and loaded questions. These posts are not necessarily disallowed. In these instances, a small write-up to give greater context to the post is required to prevent users from potentially posting this type of content en masse, spamming the sub.\n9. **Not substantive.** Non-substantive posts include one-liners or judgements/opinions that or not explained or described with a decent amount of depth. Examples include \"X is a hypocrite,\" \"These people are ridiculous,\" or \"I completely agree\". Non-substantive posts are not posts that you disagree with.\n10. **Relevant to Alberta.** Posts must in some way be relevant to Alberta *specifically.*\n11. **Health misinformation.** Health misinformation/disinformation will be removed and may be subject to a ban. Especially in relation to the pandemic.\n12. **Surveys, petitions and polls.** All surveys, petitions and polls must be pre-approved through the moderation team. Please send us a message with a link prior to posting. We currently only allow academic surveys and polls that are related to Alberta specifically.\n13. **Locals Only Flair** Posts with a \"Locals Only\" flair are limited to existing and active members of r/Alberta.\n###City/Town Subreddits\n* [Airdrie](/r/Airdrie)\n* [Banff](/r/Banff) \n* [Calgary](/r/Calgary)\n* [Canmore](/r/Canmore)\n* [Edmonton](/r/Edmonton)\n* [Fort McMurray](/r/FortMac) \n* [Fort Saskatchewan](/r/FortSaskatchewan)\n* [Grande Prairie](/r/GrandePrairie)\n* [Jasper](/r/Jasper) \n* [Lethbridge](/r/lethbridge)\n* [Lloydminster](/r/Lloydminster)\n* [Medicine Hat](/r/MedicineHat)\n* [Red Deer](/r/RedDeer)\n* [Sherwood Park](/r/SherwoodPark)\n###Alberta Subreddits\n* [Alberta Beer](/r/Albertabeer)\n* [Alberta Gardening](/r/AlbertaGardening)\n* [Alberta Jobs](/r/Albertajobs)\n* [Alberta Photography](/r/AlbertaPhotography)\n* [Alberta Politics](/r/Albertapolitics)\n* [Camping Alberta](/r/CampingAlberta)\n* [Fishing Alberta](/r/FishingAlberta)"},{"display_name":"linuxquestions","description":"This subreddit is for any question pertaining to Linux from beginner to advanced.

Photo Sharing in Community Threads**\nThis sub is for discussing photography, not just sharing your work. We have regular community threads where you can share your photos. Posting images is allowed as self-post using the photo as an example for the discussion to either begin a conversation about aspects of the example or to ask a photography-related question. The image should be used to support an overall broad and nonspecific topic/question rather than the focus of the post. Visit r/photographs, our sister photo sharing sub. \n**2. Purchasing Advice, Troubleshooting Pricing and Post-processing/Style/Emulation Questions Should Be Directed to the Question Thread**\nQuestions asking for help with equipment purchasing advice, troubleshooting, pricing or post-processing/style/emulation should be posted as comments in the most recent Official Question thread, stickied at the top of the subreddit. \nBefore posting, please check our extensive FAQ; your question may already have been answered! When seeking purchase recommendations, please be *specific* about how much you can spend. (See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/wiki/buying#wiki_how_do_i_specify_my_price_range_.2F_budget_when_asking_for_recommendations.3F) for guidelines.) \nIf you do not wish to post your equipment purchasing advice or troubleshooting questions to the Official Questions thread we cordially invite you to post your question to /r/AskPhotography instead. They love questions as standalone posts!\n**3. Stand Alone Questions Must Contain A Minimum Amount of Context and Not Be Commonly Asked or Duplicate Questions**\nInteresting discussions/questions on broader topics may be permitted as self-posts at the moderators' discretion. Please ensure you have used the search function before posting as common, duplicate questions will be removed. Please also ensure you include enough information for your question to be answered or a discussion to be had. Post titles *must include details as to the subject of the post.*\n**4. No Spam or Self-Promotion**\nAny self-promotion content must constitute no more than 10% of your submissions to the sub or Reddit as a whole, per [Reddit's \nsite-wide guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). No direct for-profit advertising or self-promotion of any kind is \npermitted outside of the relevant weekly community threads. Otherwise please instead [buy an \nad](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising). We do not allow any blogspam, advertisements, shortlinks, seeking votes for contests, \nreferral links, crowdsourced funding links, circlejerking, karmawhoring, surveys and/or market research, or DAE/ITAP posts. \n**5. No Classified Ads or Job Offers**\nIf you want to sell a photography item to Redditors or want to buy a photography item from a Redditor, please use /r/photomarket. If you just want to share some great photography-related deals, please use /r/PhotographyDeals. If you are looking for a photographer or retoucher to do a job for you, head over to r/PhotographyJobs.\n**6. No Rants**\nThis is not the place to have non-constructive rants about photography or photographic trends that you happen to dislike\n**7. No Personal Attacks** \nNo personal attacks of any kind. Violations may result in a ban.\n**8. Lost \u0026amp; Found**\nIf you've lost or found a piece of photography equipment, please head over to the [Lost \u0026amp; \nFound](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/vtkmis/photography_lost_found_late_2022/).\n**9. Flair is for Portfolios**\nUse the flair system only for your portfolio and nothing else!

Posts about living in Japan, whether temporarily or permanently belong in either r/movingtojapan, r/teachinginjapan, or r/japanlife. Translation requests should be posted in r/translator. Posts that belong in other subreddits will be removed or redirected. General discussion posts are welcome in /r/JapanTravelTips.\n* **No low effort posts.** Be specific in the questions you're asking. Include information such as: Where you're starting; YOUR dates of travel; budget; genera; interests or things you like to do. This information can have a significant impact on the suggestions the community provides to you. Posts that contain minimal information (\"Where should I go?\"), excessively broad questions (\"Tips for Tokyo?\"), or other low effort / karma-gleaning posts (\"I miss Japan!\") will be removed.\n* **Itinerary posts must be clearly identified in their titles, and theymust include more information than dates and location.** It is not the job of this subreddit to fill the gaps in your itinerary for you. Itinerary posts must have sufficient supporting information and specific questions so that the community can help. Any itinerary post that does not meet these requirements will be removed.\n* **No posts primarily focused on individual establishments or services.** The review sections of the aggregator sites such as TripAdvisor, Yelp, Expedia, Tabelog, etc. have better and more up-to-date information and recommendations on individual establishments or services such as travel agencies, booking agencies, lodgings, restaurants, shops, etc. Specific questions within larger posts (such as itineraries) are allowed, as are questions regarding accommodating the special needs of a person (eg. wheelchair accessible bathrooms, guide dogs) or in case of emergencies.\n* **No self promotion.** This includes advertising business services you are directly connected to. If you want to submit your own content, its primary goal should be to drive or jumpstart discussion on r/JapanTravel. (A example of this is a trip report that includes links to photo albums hosted on a third party site.) If the primary outcome of your post, regardless of your original intent, is to drive traffic to your blog/vlog/Instagram/portfolio/etc., your post will be removed.\n* **Meet-up requests for tourists or transient travelers are only allowed in official Meet-Up Megathread stickied at the top of the sub.** A new thread is automatically created each month, so please keep meet-up related posts limited to the thread that corresponds to the month you'll be visiting Japan.\n* **No solicitation posts.** This includes souvenir/merchandise purchase requests, accommodation/restaurant booking requests, survey or crowdsourcing requests, event ticket purchasing requests, or location photo/video requests. The only exception to this rule is that we allow ticket resale in the monthly meet-up megathread only. Posts that violate this rule will be removed.\n* **No \"meta\" posts about this sub** (i.e., \"Why do people post the same itineraries all the time?\") No PMs to individual mods about removed comments or posts. Problems or questions should be directed to moderators via the modmail interface.\n* **Keep content PG-13 and legal.** We do not allow posts seeking information on illegal activities, circumventing laws in Japan, or adult entertainment services, nor do we allow comments encouraging illegal, questionable, or otherwise dangerous behavior. Please refrain from discussions regarding adult-oriented topics, such as sex tourism, drugs, gambling, etc.\n* **Be civil.** Posts and comments should be polite and helpful. Harassment of other users or mods, trolling, posting of users' personal information, repeated intentional rule breaking, hijacking other users' threads to complain about concerns with the sub or mods, or other general unsavory behavior will be met with bans. We take this rule very seriously, and will enforce it as necessary to keep up the quality of information in this sub.\n* **Trip reports and other informative posts are welcome on this subreddit.** If you are going to share your experience by writing a trip report, review, guide, or set of tips, please make sure you do so in an organized and detailed fashion. Such posts should be made as text posts only, with any photos or relevant external content linked within the post.\n* **No standalone posts on visas or border policy.** Per our policy - we don't allow standalone visa-related or border policy questions. You are free to discuss related issues in our weekly discussion threads, however, we recommend directly contacting your local Japanese embassy or consulate. Comments on how to skirt visa or immigration rules will be removed and the authors may be banned.\n### Discord\n* [Announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/zt7ht7/official_rjapantravel_discord/)\n* [Join Link](https://discord.gg/3f7KBUMwU4)\n### Megathreads\n* [Meet-Up - January 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/18q73ke/monthly_meetup_thread_january/)\n* [Weekly Discussion - December 29, 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/18tmmiz/weekly_japan_travel_information_and_discussion/)\n### Search Posts by Category\n[Trip Reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/search?q=flair%3A%27trip+report%27\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n[Itineraries](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/search?q=flair%3A%27Itinerary%27\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n[Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/search?q=flair%3A%27Recommendations%27\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n[Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/search?q=flair%3A%27Question%27\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n[Advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/search?q=flair%3A%27Advice%27\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\nFlairs are added automatically by the first matching keyword in your post.

No Hate Speech - No hate speech allowed whatsoever. This is a ZERO tolerance policy. This rule includes any terminology that is used as a slur or pejorative against anyone; even if you’ve personally reclaimed the word, does not mean everyone has, and we ask that you respect that when speaking with other users. \nIf you must use a slur to in your submission, we ask that you censor it as follows: F-slur, T-slur, S-slur, etc. Using asterisks or other symbols to censor part or all of the word is not acceptable.\n2. Be Respectful - Respect the people who belong here. Including:\n - No insulting transgender people, their appearance, or purposeful misgendering.\n - No treating being transgender as a mental illness or as being lesser in any way.\n - No arguing with transgender people about their identity.\n - No arguing with transgender people about their vulnerabilities, including anything related to sports, laws, etc.\n - Anything else the Moderation Team deems disrespectful.\n3. Prohibited Post Types - To maintain a positive, inclusive, non-confrontational environment, we reserve the right to prohibit certain types of posts on this subreddit. This includes, but is not limited to:\n - Videos or Podcasts\n - Debates that challenge any facet of transgender existence\n - Asking for any critique of your appearance\n - Requests for name advice\n - Requests for medical advice, including DIY HRT\n - For a complete list of prohibited topics, please see this page: https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/wiki/ppt/\n4. This Space is for Transgender People – While we appreciate that many cisgender people want to support transgender people, r/trans is a space for transgender people to discuss their lives and issues that surround them, and submissions from outside of the community are not welcome in this subreddit. \nIf you are a cis person with a question about the trans community, or the partner of a cis person, please ask your question in r/AskTransgender. \nIf you are the parent of a trans child, you can ask your questions in r/cisparenttranskid.\n5. No Pornography or Suggestive Posts – Posts that are pornographic or sexually explicit are prohibited. This includes:\n - Nudity below the waist or \"female presenting nipples\" (This is Reddit's guidelines).\n - Images of a person wearing solely underwear\n - Images that entice through sexy or flirty posing\n - Deliberately provocative titles (such as \"Would you date me?\")\n - Erotica/\"text porn\"\n - Note that we do allow NSFW text posts that discuss issues a user may be having in their life.\n6. No Gatekeeping Ideologies - Our subreddit is one specifically aimed at allowing people to explore their identity and creating a safe space for those identities to be explored. Truscum, transmedicalist, and other gatekeeping ideologies do not serve our subreddit's goals and comments or posts promoting such are prohibited. This specifically includes suggesting that gender affirming medical care should only be available to adults.\n7. No Advertisements, Surveys, Petitions, or Crowdfunding –We do not allow advertising or promotion of any kind on r/trans. This includes links to things such as OnlyFans, Instagram, Discord, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, or any sort of crowdfunding websites. \nIf you wish to advertise a new transgender-related subreddit, please Message the Moderation Team using the link below.\n8. No Sharing Hate Speech/Bigtory – We do not allow sharing images, links, or crossposts containing hate speech or bigoted content. As trans people, we face enough bigotry in our daily lives, and we do not want our users exposed to such content just by scrolling through the subreddit nor to provide the originator a larger platform. \nYou are welcome to describe what you experienced in a text post for the purposes of venting or seeking help. Please remember to flair the post as “Trigger” or “Possible Trigger” as is appropriate.\n9. No Posts About Self Harm or Suicide – We understand that life can be difficult, and at times life can feel overwhelming or that you have no other options, but there are always options available, we promise you that. If you are experiencing a crisis, we ask that rather than making a post here, please reach out to one of the resources listed on [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines), where most country’s crisis lines are listed, as we’re unable to host posts about suicide and self-harm here.\n10. Address The Community Respectfully – Please keep in mind that we are a diverse community, with many different experiences, and we expect our members to respect that when making posts/comments. We ask that you remember that this is not a community specifically for any one gender, and that you don't address the community in that way. This includes things that says something like \"Hey (guys/girls/dudes/women/men)\" and the like.\n11. Adult Content Accounts – Accounts that have a history of posting adult content, participate in adult content subreddits, or have links to adult content services in their profile are not permitted to participate in this subreddit. r/trans is an all-ages space, and we have an obligation to protect our underage users from being exposed to adult content. \nPlease see this link for further information on this topic: https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/rjl6id/updated_nsfw_rules/\n12. Chasers are Not Welcome Here – r/trans is a safe space for trans people, their stories, discussions, and content. It is NOT a place for people to fetishize us, attempt to hit on or pick up users, or any other general creepy behavior (“Chaser” behavior). Similarly, if such behavior is seen in your account’s post/comment history, you are not permitted to participate in r/trans. The Moderation Team maintains discretion as to what is included in this rule.\n13. No DM Requests – Users are not allowed to ask others to DM, chat with, or contact them on another platform for ANY reason. This subreddit is for finding community, not establishing one-on-one connections or friendships. \nThis rule does not prohibit users from looking for support groups or other such activities in their area; it is specifically prohibiting “making friends” or other other private communication requests.\n# [Read our Expanded Rules here](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/wiki/expanded-rules)\n# [Read about our Prohibited Post Types here](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/wiki/ppt)"},{"display_name":"comicbooks","description":"### [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/wiki/faq) - [Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/wiki/recommendations) - [Weekly Pull List](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/1lcibvm/weekly_pull_list_for_06182025_discussion/) - [Questions and Suggestions](https://redd.it/1lfa83p) - [Swag Bag Friday](https://redd.it/1j073ku)\nTo set your flair please use the [flair picker](http://pfwr.info/rcomicbooks/).

Be respectful to others - this includes no hostility, racism, sexism, bigotry, etc.\n2. Submissions must be *future focused*. All posts must have an initial comment, a **Submission Statement**, that suggests a line of future-focused discussion for the topic posted. We want this submission statement to elaborate on the topic being posted and suggest how it might be discussed in relation to the future. AI-focused posts are only allowed on the weekend.\n3. No memes, reaction gifs or similarly low effort content. Images/gifs require a starter comment.\n4. No spamming - this includes polls and surveys. This also includes promoting any content in which you have any kind of financial or non-financial stake.\n5. Bots require moderator permission to operate\n6. Comments must be on topic, contribute to the discussion and be of sufficient length. Comments that dismiss well-established science without compelling evidence are a distraction to discussion of futurology and may be removed.\n7. Account age: \u0026gt;1 day to comment, \u0026gt;5 days to submit content\n8. Submissions and comments of accounts whose combined karma is too far in the negatives will be removed\n9. Avoid posting content that is a duplicate of content posted within the last 7 days.\n10. Text posts need to encourage in-depth and detailed discussion. Avoid generalized invitations to discuss frequently discussed topics. Submissions with **[in-depth]** in the title have stricter post length and quality guidelines\n11. Titles must accurately and truthfully represent the content of the submission\n12. Support original sources - avoid blogs/websites that are primarily rehosted content\n13. Content older than 6 months must have [month, year] in the title\n\u0026gt;\nFor details on the rules see the\n [**Rules Wiki**](/r/futurology/wiki/rules).\n\u0026gt;\nFor details on moderation procedures, see the\n [**Transparency Wiki**](/r/Futurology/wiki/transparency).\n \n\u0026gt;\n \n#####On Futurology\nIf history studies our past and social sciences study our present, what is the study of our future? Future(s) Studies (colloquially called \"future(s)\" by many of the field's practitioners) is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to hypothesize the possible, probable, preferable, or alternative future(s). \nOne of the fundamental assumptions in future(s) studies is that the future is plural rather than singular, that is, that it consists of alternative future(s) of varying degrees of likelihood but that it is impossible in principle to say with certainty which one will occur. \n#####Recommended Links\n* [/r/Collapse vs /r/Futurology Debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5ocxj9/rcollapse_vs_rfuturology_debate_does_human/) \n* [The r/Futurology Wiki](/r/Futurology/wiki/)\n* [Futurist Blogs, Sites, and Resources](http://goo.gl/wJSULw)\n* [Futurist Reading List](http://goo.gl/jzYvZ9)\n* [Futurology Moderator's Forum](/r/FuturologyModerators)\n* [Removed Content Archive](/r/futurologyremovals)\n* [Tips on how to find content to submit](/r/Futurology/comments/84m56h/tips_on_how_to_find_content_to_submit_to/)\n* [Multi-Reddit of the SFTNetwork]\n(http://www.reddit.com/user/xenophon1/m/futurist)\n#####Related Subreddits\n**For a list of related subreddits, hover over top menu.**\n[popular discussions today](http://goo.gl/1q7oUp)\n[transparency](http://goo.gl/C0vOBH)\n[AMAs](/r/Futurology/wiki/ama)\n[domain blacklist](http://goo.gl/zDwI3D)\n[IRC](http://goo.gl/Nt9IIa)\n[glossary of terms](/r/Futurology/wiki/glossary#wiki)\n[source quality](/r/futurology/wiki/sourcequality#quality)\n\u0026gt;#\n\u0026gt;* [Universe](http://goo.gl/tzkaH6)\n* [Space Settlement](/r/Space_Settlement)\n* [Space Flight](/r/SpaceFlight)\n* [Cosmology](/r/Cosmology)\n* [Space Videos](/r/Spacevideos)\n* [AskTechnology](/r/AskTechnology)\n* [Scifi](/r/Scifi)\n* [Space](/r/space)\n\u0026gt;#\n\u0026gt;* [Transhuman](http://goo.gl/vFWcxv)\n* [**Transhuman**](/r/Transhuman)\n* [Transhumanism](/r/Transhumanism)\n* [Nootropics](/r/Nootropics)\n* [Cyberpunk](/r/Cyberpunk)\n* [Longevity](/r/longevity)\n\u0026gt;#\n\u0026gt;* [Futurology](http://goo.gl/pr7rJp)\n* [**Futurology**](/r/Futurology)\n* [FuturePorn](/r/FuturePorn)\n* [Retro Futurism](/r/RetroFuturism)\n* [Automate](/r/Automate)\n* [Simulate](/r/Simulate)\n* [TheVenusProject](/r/TheVenusProject)\n* [Basic Income](/r/BasicIncome)\n* [Futurist Party](/r/FuturistParty)\n\u0026gt;#\n\u0026gt;* [Singularity](http://goo.gl/P3nvU5)\n* [**Singularity**](/r/Singularity)\n* [Robotics](/r/Robotics)\n* [Artificial](/r/Artificial)\n\u0026gt;#\n\u0026gt;* [**SFT Network**](/r/SingularityNetwork)\n* [FAQ](http://intelligence.org/ie-faq/)\n* [Browse All](http://www.reddit.com/user/xenophon1/m/futurist)\n* [Follow on Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/SFTNet/list)\n* [Join us on IRC](http://cbe005.chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.snoonet.org\u0026amp;nick=nickname%3F%3F%3F\u0026amp;channel=%23singularitynetwork)\n[](#heads)\n[](https://discord.gg/9C9d9PZ)\n[Chat with us on Discord!](https://www.discord.gg/9C9d9PZ)\n[](#AMApromo)\n[](#AMAtext)\n[Apply to be a Mod here!](/r/futurology/wiki/moderator)"},{"display_name":"namenerds","description":"**ABOUT:**\nAre you looking for a name for your baby?

Some social network info will be exempted on a case by case basis. \n5\\. **No Spam:** If most of your posts and comments are to your own projects, then you're taking advantage of our community and spamming.

There are no petitions allowed on the sub either.\n6\\. **No Reposting:** Reposts will be removed, please search before you post. If you want to post another view of the same story, we ask that you contribute it to the comments of the original post.

Any effort to argue or lobby beyond the relevant context will not be permitted. For clarity, refer back to Rule #1.\n6. No \"is my meat safe?\" posts. We don't know.

Do NOT editorialize the title of the submission; (minor) changes for clarity may be acceptable if the original title is clickbait, or failed to summarize its actual content.\n**Original Source Policy**| Content submitted should be of original source, or at least contain partially original reporting on top of existing information. Exceptions can be made for content in foreign language or any other exceptional cases. Fully paywalled articles are not allowed.

Top level comments must be substantive and contain more than 20 characters.\n**No tech support or PC building questions** | These belong in /r/techsupport, /r/buildapc or any relevant tech subreddits. If your post asks a question about a specific product or need, it probably belongs elsewhere. This includes 'What should I buy?', 'Does a ____ do what I need?', 'How much is _____ worth?' and 'How long until (something obvious) happens?' type questions.\n**Serious and intelligent discussion** | We allow discussion posts on relevant topics to hardware; there should however be at least background information and relevancy to demonstrate such a discussion is worthwhile. Low effort posts such as \"What is ______ and what does it do?\" is not acceptable.\n**Rumor Policy** | **No unsubstantiated rumors** - Rumors or other claims/information not directly from official sources must have evidence to support them.

Respect other users|... Even when those users show disrespect themselves. We're better than the trolls and haters, and we can show that by not rising to take the bait. Be respectful, and we'll all be happier for it.\n2. No abuse|Abuse is absolutely banned here, and is treated extremely seriously. Abusive users will be banned.\n3. Discrimination is forbidden|There is no such thing as \"valid discrimination,\" and this sub will remove any post or comment that demonstrates racism, sexism, body shaming or any other bigotry you care to name. Equality is the watchword.\n4. Non-binary does not mean non-trans|Non-op, genderqueer, agender or any other denomination of transgender is still transgender. Treating a person like they're lesser or somehow inferior because they're non-binary is immoral, and shows a clear lack of understanding.\n5. Asking for birthnames is not cool|Asking for, or posting, a person's personal information can be dangerous, and it's also against [the site-wide rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules).\n6. Malicious reporting is abuse|Maliciously reporting someone who doesn't break our rules spams the report system, and it's against the site-wide rules. Don't do it.\n7. ABSOLUTELY NO PORN!|There are places online which cater to that *particular* fetish, but this is not one of them. Users who are here to post porn or advertise will be removed.\n8. Tag any NSFW stuff|If you got a cool tattoo or something else that's incidentally NSFW, please tag it as such.\n9. Destructive criticism is abuse|It's hard to convey inflection and intent via text. What may seem like tough love to one person may come across as hatred or abuse to another. It's not helpful, don't do it.\n10. No soliciting medical advice|We're not doctors and we can't vouch for the safety or validity of any medical information. Posts that ask for or give advice on how to obtain or use DIY hormones will be removed, as will comments that explicitly state where to get black-market drugs. These are dangerous medications, not toys.\n11. Submissions or comments from users with 0 or less karma will be removed|This is to prevent trolling. If you have less than 0 karma, you won't be allowed to submit here. This is a hard rule.\n12. No \"X celebrity/politician is a transphobe\" threads|We all probably already know and we don't need that kind of negativity in our **Safe Space.**\n13. If you want to promote something, message the moderators first|This sub is a **Safe Space,** not a knowledge aggregator, not a traffic generator, and certainly **not a public wallet.** There are far better places like /r/transspace to post surveys or tell people about a trans-related service or group. (You should ask the mod(s) there before posting too.)\n14. Do not disrupt the **Safe Space**|If the mods think you're being too much of an arsehole, but it's not covered by the rules, your post will be removed and you might be banned. We want to cultivate a warm, **Safe Space** environment, and anything that goes against that may be subject to removal and the submitter to disciplinary action.\n15. Please keep all selfies in the selfie thread.|Please keep all selfies in the selfie thread or post them on another subreddit that's releveant. Any selfies outside of the selfie thread will be removed. Photos of IDs and medications are also forbidden because they include personal and/or medical information.\n##General Guidelines:##\nGeneral|Guidelines\n:-:|:-:|:-: \nComment with respect| It's important to remember that behind every username is an individual with motivations, goals, and problems just like you. We never really know what the situation is on the other side of the keyboard, so please try to be mindful of what you say and how you treat others.\nVote with care| This is a safe place for people who need to talk about their life as a trans person. If we downvote posts and comments into the ground, we discourage free expression. Save your downvotes for trolls.\n\"Will I pass\" threads are discouraged| Whilst not banned, WIP threads are discouraged from being posted here. If you do post these threads, please accept that our official policy is honesty: if you do not pass, or might not pass in the future, subscribers are encouraged to tell you this (in the nicest possible way). We are not here to lie to you.\n***\n**Other subreddits you might like:**\n* /r/asktransgender - Self-posts and questions from trans people\n* /r/ftm - For the FAAB among us\n* /r/genderqueer - For non-binary folks\n* /r/transadorable - Adorable trans people selfies: child-friendly!\n* /r/transgender - Transgender articles and links\n* /r/transpositive - Success stories and posts\n* /r/TransSpace - A safe place for all trans-identified people\n* /r/transvoice - A voice-coaching subreddit for transgender people of all genders.

It will also allow other people to search the sub easier and reduce questions asked.\n- ***Rule 3 - Posts must have a flair.***\nPlease make sure to use the correct flairs for posts so people can help accordingly.\n- ***Rule 4 - No advertising or spam.***\nPlease do not spam your social media profile or your giveaways. If you have a promo code to share that is beneficial that is fine.\n- ***Rule 5 - Do NOT attempt to abuse the user flair.***\nPlease do NOT promote your youtube or social media channels nor include any abuse or foul language in the user flair. Doing so will result in you getting a permanent user flair stating you have broken this rule.\n- ***Rule 6 - Do NOT sell your shoes on this sub.***\nPlease do not create posts about selling your shoes on this sub. If you want to sell your stuff head over to r/therunningrack/.\n- ***Rule 7 - Read the FAQ!.***\nAsking simple questions that can be found in the FAQ will lead to your post being removed.\n- ***Rule 8 - Have an informative comment with your shoe photo.***\nPlease include an informative comment that will provide the reader with an understanding of how the shoe fits/feels, the context for buying it, etc. and not with a blank statement of \"wow look at my shoes!\".\n- ***Rule 9 - Only post about your shoes if you have feedback \u0026amp; will answer questions about it.***\nPlease be able to offer some feedback (so go for at least one run in your shoes!) - shoes without any information/context will be removed. Let's make this sub informative and NOT a glorified google image search!\nPlease do not post the bottom of your outsole without an informative comment.\nPlease do not post your 10 shoe rotation that has not been run in.\n- ***Rule 10 - Deal flair is for deals that benefit everyone, and not just yourself.***\nTo clarify, please refrain from posting images of shoe boxes accompanied by receipts. Instead, kindly share deals that are accessible to the wider community, and provide either a link or specific location where the deal can be obtained. In the case of sharing an in-person, brick and mortar deal, please include a photograph depicting the deal within the store. This helps to ensure that the deal is still available for interested users.\n- ***Rule 11 - Do NOT post Youtube videos.***\nPlease do not post Youtube videos. We do not want to be a free ad service for Youtube channels. Please do not create posts discussing \"your favourite or most disliked channels\". You are free to mention Youtube links in comments, as long as you are not promoting your own channel.\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n***Search the sub with Google***:\nPlease use [this link to search the subreddit](https://www.google.com/search?q=url%3Areddit.com%2Fr%2Frunningshoegeeks+INSERT+SEARCH+TERMS+HERE) for your question before posting. \nSomeone else may have already asked the same question.\nMoreover, Google search is often more effective than Reddit's built-in search feature.\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n***Looking for advice?***:\n**Before you post, have you checked the [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/wiki/index#wiki_common_questions)? Are you [looking for a Nike Pegasus Turbo replacement?](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/lfmvt6/about_all_the_nike_pegasus_turbo_replacement/)?**\nIf your answer is not there, please read below.\nIn order for the community to assist you better please include the following in your post:\n•Budget\n•Intended use and distance (speed workouts, walking, long runs, easy runs, races, versatile)\n•Foot size/shape (narrow, normal or wide feet)\n•Foot strike (heel/midfoot/forefoot or pronation requirements)\n•Shoe weight preference (Light \u0026amp; nimble or heavier bigger stack?)\n• Prefered feel (Firm ride or soft ride?)\n•Surfaces (road, track, trail, treadmill)\n•Any prior shoes you may have liked or disliked\nPlease include anything else you might think would be helpful.\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n***Include Shoe Name in Your Post***:\nWe understand you know the Nike running catalogue like the back of your hand, but not everyone has this knowledge.\nTo help other users of this sub identify shoes and purchase them, please include the model name of the shoe photo you are posting.\nAn example of how to do this with a post title is as follows;\n- Photo with one shoe: \"Hype is real! (Endorphin Speed)\"\n- Photo with two shoes: \"My race buddies (Next%2 \u0026amp; Alphafly)\"\n- Photo with three shoes or more: \"My weekly rotation (Mach4, RebelV2, Pegasus38 \u0026amp; Next%2)\"\nFor those who have a very big collection and it won't fit the post title, please post the list of shoe names as a comment.\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n***Use the Weekly Thread***:\nPlease use the dedicated weekly thread for showing off your new shoes for any deals you may have purchased or for just showing your new shoes without having the need to comment about them in detail.\nAny posts that are made outside of this thread in the related matter will be removed.\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n***Informative Comment with Photo***:\nWe kindly ask that you include an informative comment with your shoe photo that will provide the users on this sub with an understanding of how the shoe may fit/feel, the context for buying it, etc.\nWe do not expect an essay, just simple feedback that will make your post more useful.\nLet us help make this sub a resource for those who want to learn more!\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n***First Run Flair***:\nPlease use the First Run flair for your first run.\nWe know you are excited to post your first thoughts, so please make everyone aware you have only done one run so far.\nThe Initial Thoughts flair should be applied when you have done a few more runs with your shoes.\nA few more runs will help you understand the characteristics of the shoe better and may change your opinion from your first run.\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n***Initial Thoughts or Review?***:\nAre you not sure if what you are posting is an initial thought or review?\nThe Initial Thoughts flare should be used for shoes you have done two or three runs in, giving feedback on how it fits, feels, etc. It is short and not an in-depth review.\nThe Review flare should be used for shoes that have a good amount of mileage on them. Please consider that shoes usually break-in after 30-50 miles (48km - 80km). When posting a review please follow the template [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/wiki/review-template).\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n***Deal Share Flair***:\nPlease format your deal post as follows: [Country] Retailer Name - Shoe Name - Price. For example: [UK] Nike.co.uk - Pegasus 39 - £79. \nAlso, please include a link to the product to save time searching for it.

Please treat all users with respect and politeness.\n2. If submitting a film, trailer, or other creative content, you must select the \"FILM\" flair and include a submission statement (a comment on your post) elaborating on the following: \nIf you are seeking advice or feedback, explain what it is you need help with, whether that's lighting, cinematography, audio, editing, or something else entirely. There are many aspects to filmmaking, so specify what you want people to focus rather than simply asking for general feedback. It may also help if you provide some of your own thoughts on your work, such as what you think needs improvement and why. \nIf sharing your work and not seeking advice, your post must serve a detailed educational purpose for the rest of the community. Outline your involvement in the project and provide some beneficial insight on how it was made. For example, you can detail lighting setups, explain how a particularly complex shot was achieved, or go over any setbacks that hit production and what you did to overcome them. \nAll submission statements must be at least 100 characters in length and be submitted within 30 minutes of submitting your post. Please remember that simply posting your film or page for views or subscriptions is not allowed.\n3. **No** Travel Videos or V-Log videos are allowed. Try /r/videography instead!\n4. Please flair your posts correctly.\n5.

You can be happy about a good result without using such charged language. \n* **Do not tell people to run at unsafe settings.** You're welcome to run them yourself, but respect the [safe voltages listed in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/wiki/faq#wiki_what_are_the_max_safe_voltages_and_temperatures_for...) when answering questions. \n* **Do not advocate RMA fraud, or discuss attempting fraudulent RMAs.** Warranties are for manufacturing defects, if you accidentally damage something that's on you.

Be civil and respectful to each other.**\nAct in good faith on this subreddit, posts and answers. Try not to waste people's time. No trolling or shitposts here.\n**2. No arbitrary link titles (How to answer including a link)**\nInclude a description of what you are linking to in case the link breaks, i.e. Name of the video and creator/uploader. Do not use URL shorteners, Tumblr, or partner links, these are all automatically removed.\n**3. Do not repeat something already suggested.**\nThe OP does not need to be overwhelmed with multiple suggestions of the same thing. If you have replied with the same thing as someone else did earlier, you should delete your comment.\n**4. Reply “Solved!” to the first correct answer**\nWhen what you’re looking for is found, reply Solved! in reply to the first (oldest) comment that gave you the answer.\n**5. Do not delete post/answer**\nDo not delete your answer after it has been acknowledged. Do not delete your post. People are interested in what has been asked for, what has been suggested, and want to see what has been found.\n**6. No reposting within one week.**\nWait one week before reposting a question (Please link to your old posts to rule out previous suggestions)\n**7. Music posts**\nMake it easy for people to help you by recording a vocaroo or providing an online synthesiser recording of your music. Describing musical notes as text without including a vocaroo or other playable link will get your post removed - this includes “do doo dooo” or other attempts at written music notation, including Solfège. This applies even if the singer doo-doo-doo’s the melody in the song. If there is a similar song to the one you are looking for, provide a link to that.\n**8. No People**\nNo posts such as “who is this person”. Actors/actresses and historical figures who are not common knowledge within the public domain are off limits. This rule will generally be handled on a case by case basis.\n**9. Nothing Illegal**\nNo TOMT posts looking for Warez or requests for anything illegal. This includes any streams for movies or sports or anything of that nature. Torrents, trackers, piracy, etc.\n**10. No NSFW Posts**\nNo porn. Use /r/tipofmypenis for porn. No gore or animal violence. Please note that horror films (simulated gore) are ok, provided they have a NSFW tag.\n**11. Post format**\nYou can only ask one question per post, and your post title must start with [TOMT] - i.e. [TOMT][MOVIE][1990s] Movie about a kid who befriends an alien. Use a date range if you need to - nobody knows when you were a kid. Include your home country if relevant, i.e. if you are looking for a regional TV show.\n**12. No bribes**\nDo not offer rewards in the post as an attempt to publicise your post. You can reward people once the post is solved if you wish.\n**13. Participation**\nComment on your post for it to be approved.\nThe poster must comment on their post to make it visible in the subreddit, and to acknowledge the subreddit rules. Use this comment to add anything else you need to. Posts submitted but not commented on after 60 minutes will be removed. Reply to suggestions made as frequently as possible - do not abandon your post!\n**14. No AI generated answers**\nDo not copy and paste AI-generated answers. Prompt-generated suggestions are generally unhelpful and occasionally entirely nonexistent. That said, if you receive an AI-generated answer that you believe may be correct, please research said suggested media to make sure that it exists and fits the question before you bring it up it yourself (in your own words). If a quick search shows no evidence of the existence of what you're about to suggest, don't suggest it.\n---\n* Frequently Asked [**Questions**](/r/tipofmytongue/wiki/faq) \n* Need help with a tune?

This is to help reduce spamming in the subreddit; if you wish to discuss your brand name supplement, simply list the ingredients and dosages, not the brand name.**\n- This is a subreddit designed for supplements, so obviously most users will be biased for supplements. Discussion on the relative pros and cons for supplementation are accepted and encouraged. However, discussions or rants declaring a supplement or supplement regimen useless based on emotion and naturalistic fallacy rather than science or logical caution are subject to moderation. Repeated offenses or notably excessive offenses are subject to banning. (Basically, talk *with* us about something; don't be a pretentious anti-supplement douche)\n- Anything talking about supplement companies is a grey area which must be ventured cautiously. It is acceptable to talk about which companies and suppliers you like but unacceptable to spam for them. Although subjective, any posts in which there is suspicion of being affiliated with a supplement company may result in banning after various considerations (contribution to community, relevance to discussion, unforeseen context, etc.) are looked at.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nGeneral Etiquette:\n- This is a science intensive subreddit. If you make a claim about a supplement and get called out on it be prepared to either cite your source or logically defend your stance.\n- [Broscience](http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/hvw03/discussion_on_broscience/) is accepted as it can lead to new theories and discoveries, but it must be clearly stated it is broscience or 'feel'.\n- Prior to posting, please review the compound on a science-based website like [**Examine.com**](http://examine.com/) rather than asking for vague 'educate me on...' posts. If making a post asking for the easy way out on learning about a compound, most likely you will just be linked to Examine.com as it is less work for us.\n* Be sure to read the /r/fitness/wiki/faq if your post is about diet/fat loss/gaining muscle.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nRelated Subreddits:\n* [r/Advanced Fitness](http://www.reddit.com/r/advancedfitness)\n* [r/Bodybuilding](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodybuilding/)\n* [r/Fitness](http://www.reddit.com/r/fitness)\n* [r/Nootropics](http://www.reddit.com/r/nootropics/)\n* [r/Stackadvice](http://www.reddit.com/r/stackadvice/)\n* [r/Weightroom](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/)"},{"display_name":"Adulting","description":"**Welcome to /r/Adulting!**\n-\nUrban Dictionary defines adulting as \"Doing something grown-up and responsible\" and that is what this subreddit is all about. \nWhether it is getting an apartment, paying bills in a timely manner, budgeting, getting a job, furthering higher education or anything else responsible, this is the place to talk about it.\nWe welcome **all content related to being responsible and put together.** Victories, tips, questions and struggles are all welcome. \n**Rules**\n-\n1. **Don't Be a Dick.** - Everyone's adulting journey is different and should be respected.

Tag and Flair all posts|Use one or more of the required title tags ([BotW], [OoT], [TP], etc) so we know which game your post is about. *Please also flair your thread* when you submit it.|\n|2. Mark Spoilers|Minor spoilers such as area titles, dungeon names, and character references are allowed but all Major spoilers including boss weaknesses, puzzle solutions, and any large story plot points must be tagged and flaired at all times. Comments must use the format `\u0026gt;!text goes here!\u0026lt;`, ex: \u0026gt;!text goes here!\u0026lt;. Titles must always be vague enough to not include spoilers. Submissions please click the \"spoiler\" button after making your post. See also our [spoiler policy](/r/zelda/w/rules/spoilerpolicy).|\n|3. Art Sources and Permission Required|All art submissions must name the artist in the post title **AND** have a clear comment containing a direct link to the original source with proof of permission to rehost, if applicable. Otherwise, submit as a link post instead! Use a reverse image search to help find the source - [Google](https://images.google.com/), [Tineye](https://tineye.com/). To post your own work, use the [OC] tag in the post title. [AI-Generated art is not allowed here](https://redd.it/zjnzkh).|\n|4. No \"Low Quality\" Posts or Non-Zelda Memes|Memes are allowed, but must be about the games. Using screenshots from the games to talk about things not from the games will be removed. Several other types of posts may be removed - [See more details on our wiki](/r/zelda/w/rules).|\n|5. Reposts|Use the search function, browse by new, check the top posts of all time, and check the hot page to see what has already been posted. Reposts in general are fine, but reposts within two months will be taken down.|\n|6. Be Civil, Be Courteous, and Be Sensible|Try and keep the peace. Aggressive personal attacks, hate speech, witchhunting, and trolling will all be removed but small disagreements are nothing to worry about. No politics of any kind are allowed. See also the [Be Civil](/r/zelda/w/becivil) policy. Report infractions and move on.|\n|7. No Piracy|No discussion or sharing of game ROMs or any copyrighted material that may have been pirated. Emulator discussion however is completely fine, including speedrunning, randomizers, texture packs, and fangames.|\n|8. No NSFW content|Pornographic content, nudity, and excessive depictions of violence are all **not permitted**. Some NSFW is fine as long as it's tagged and related to Zelda, to the extent depicted in the games. If your post contains adult themes or depictions of blood/injury, please mark it NSFW. No hypersexualized or lewd NSFW, go elsewhere.|\n|9. No Transactions|No sales or purchases. This is not a marketplace, if someone specifically requests to buy something you have created, you may respond with a link to another reputable place but no direct transactions. Please also see our page on [Dropship Spammers](/r/zelda/w/dropshippers) to be aware of scam signs.|\n|10. No Obvious Self-Promotion|Linking to something hosted on your art page or YouTube channel is fine but any obvious advertisements will be removed.|\n|11. Collections and Merchandise on Mondays only|Feel free to post NEWS about new official merchandise whenever you like but for unofficial goods, or photos of your personal collection, please post them on **Merchandise Mondays**.|\n|12. Some Screenshots on Saturdays only|Opening titles, game overs, file select screens, game endings, Dawn of the Next Day and \"funny\" names for Link are all limited to **Screenshot Saturdays** because they're posted so often. Other interesting screenshots that don't fall into one of the above categories are welcome during weekdays as well.|\n|13. Self-Post Sundays|**Self-Post Sundays** are our main discussion day, when we only allow text posts *directly about the games themselves*. Posting images, links, or anything else as self-posts on Sundays will be removed. Discussion posts are still welcome any day of the week.|\n---\n\u0026gt;#Flair Filters\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;* Group A \n *

This is a highly moderated subreddit. Please read the rules carefully before posting or commenting.\n###Subreddit Rules\n_Violations will be dealt with by some combination of warning, comment/post removal, temporary ban, or permanent ban based on moderator discretion._\n**1. All comments and posts require user flair. Link posts require a starter comment:** An [appropriate user flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/wiki/faq) must be chosen prior to attempting to post in order to contextualize the post and demonstrate a minimum effort to follow subreddit rules. All link posts require a starter comment to explain why the link is of interest to the community and to start the conversation. Posts without user flair will be immediately filtered, and link posts without starter comments will be temporarily or permanently removed upon discovery.\n**2. No requests for professional advice or general medical information:** This is not a question-and-answer forum such as /r/askreddit. You may not solicit medical advice or share personal health anecdotes about yourself, family, acquaintances, or celebrities, seek comments on care provided by other clinicians, discuss billing disputes, or otherwise seek a professional opinion from members of the subreddit. General queries about medical conditions, prognosis, drugs, or other medical topics from the lay public are not allowed.\n**3. No promotions, advertisements, surveys, or petitions:** Surveys (formal or informal) and polls are not allowed on this subreddit. You may not use the subreddit to promote your website, channel, subreddit, or product. Market research is not allowed. Petitions are not allowed. Advertising or spam may result in a permanent ban. Prior permission is required before posting educational material you were involved in making.\n**4. Link to high-quality, original research whenever possible:** Posts which rely on or reference scientific data (e.g. an announcement about a medical breakthrough) should link to the original research in peer-reviewed medical journals or respectable news sources as judged by the moderators. Avoid login or paywall requirements when possible. Please submit direct links to PDFs as text/self posts with the link in the text. Sensationalized titles, misrepresentation of results, or promotion of blatantly bad science may lead to removal.\n**5. Act professionally and decently:** /r/medicine is a public forum that represents the medical community and comments should reflect this. Please keep disagreement civil and focused on issues. Trolling, abuse, and insults (either personal or aimed at a specific group) are not allowed. Do not attack other users' flair. Keep offensive language to a minimum and do not use ethnic, sexual, or other slurs. Posts, comments, or private messages violating Reddit's content policy will be removed and reported to site administration.\n**6. No personal agendas:** Users who primarily post or comment on a single pet issue on this subreddit (as judged by moderators) will be asked to broaden participation or leave. Comments from users who appear on this subreddit only to discuss a specific political topic, medical condition, health care role, or similar single-topic issues will be removed. Comments which deviate from the topic of a thread to interject an unrelated personal opinion (e.g. politics) or steer the conversation to their pet issue will be removed.\n**7. Protect patient confidentiality:** Posting protected health information may result in an immediate ban. Please anonymize cases and remove any patient-identifiable information. For health information arising from the United States, follow the [HIPAA Privacy Rule's De-Identification Standard](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html).\n**8. No careers or homework questions:** Questions relating to medical school admissions, courses or exams should be asked elsewhere. Links to medical training subreddits and a compilation of careers and specialty threads are available on the [subreddit wiki](/r/medicine/wiki/index). Medical career advice may be asked only in the stickied biweekly careers thread.\n**9. No throwaway accounts:** Posts from user accounts less than one week old and/or with less than 10 comment karma are not allowed.\n**10. No memes or low-effort posts:** Memes, image links (including social media screenshots), images of text, or other low-effort posts or comments are not allowed. Videos require a text post or starter comment that summarizes the video and provides context.\n**11. Temporary Rule: [NO COVID MISINFORMATION, CONSPIRACY THEORIES OR OTHER NONSENSE](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/p92sr9/new_policy/)**\nIn addition, we ask that medditors refrain from commenting on posts which are in violation of the rules above, and to follow general **[reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).**\nMeddit has a tight spam filter and moderators may act with their judgement beyond the scope of these rules to maintain the quality of the subreddit. If your post doesn't show up shortly after posting, make sure that it meets our posting criteria. If it does, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmedicine) with a permalink to your post and explanation. Medditors are free to message the moderation team for a second opinion on moderator actions.\n----------\n**RELATED REDDITS:**\nThere a number of smaller, more specific medicine-related subreddits.

If you have another question, you may have some luck searching the subreddit for related questions / topics. \n---\n---\n**Guidelines:** Detailed Guidelines in our Wiki [here!](http://goo.gl/cxxQRd)\n**1. Constructive criticism \u0026amp; respect**\n* Constructive criticism or disagreement is fine – judgmental and mean comments are not. Comments must be constructive and contribute to conversation. Name calling, abusive comments, idea bashing, budget-shaming, or arguing with other posters will not be tolerated. In this vein, we do not allow AITA / AITB posts here. Weddit is also gender \u0026amp; relationship diverse, so please keep that in mind when addressing posts!\n**2. Context**\n* All posts must be directly related to your own wedding or your own personal experiences with weddings and planning. We encourage you to share location for any discussion of budget, etiquette, timeline, or other region-influenced topic for this international subreddit. We do not allow anniversary posts for inactive Wedditors, guest attire posts, or any allow medical advice posts or comments, including weight change and COVID19 decisions. We do not allow sharing your current / goal size or weight.\n**3. Text Only Tuesdays**\n* Only text posts are allowed from 12 AM to 11:59 PM EDT on Tuesdays. All image/video only posts or posts that require images will be removed. Please feel free to post your pictures and videos - including engagement ring photos- any other day of the week! (Please note videos must be hosted on v.Reddit or Streamable). \n**4. No memes/funny gif posts:** \n* /r/trollxweddings is a better place for these.\n**5. No bashing posts** \n* We do not allow bashing posts such as \"what's a tradition you hate?\" or \"what decor is overrated?” or \"what are your unpopular wedding opinions\". Weddit is made up a diverse group of people with diverse traditions. Treating the typical wedding in your area as THE right version of weddings is not cool. We should treat other weddings the way we want ours treated.\n**6. No 'tacky'**\n* We generally don't allow the use of the word tacky here, including asking 'is this tacky'. 'Tacky' is subjective, not descriptive, and too often weaponized. Situations vary greatly, and there is no one sole arbiter of etiquette. We also don't allow debates on the etiquette of cash bars.\n**7. No Advertising, Market Research, or GoFundMe Links**\n* No monetizing the subreddit. This includes but is not limited to: advertising, self-promoting, sharing your work, affiliate links, blogs/vlogs, market research / feedback solicitation, free giveaways. Coupons/discounts can be shared in the Daily Discussion Chat. We do not allow GoFundMe, vote solicitations, or other similar requests. \n**Vendor AMAs:** Please contact the mods first for verification. Please note that you cannot advertise in your AMA.\n**8. Post multiple photos in an album, not as multiple posts**\n* When sharing multiple pictures in a short period of time, please post them in an album/in the same post. Repeat or similar posts that do not uniquely contribute to discussion may be removed. \n**9. Privacy/identifying information**\n* You may include your own names and faces at your discretion. Addresses and last names of other people must be obscured, and wedding website URLs are not allowed.\n**10. Don't share Weddit content elsewhere**\n* No sharing other posts, pictures, etc from Weddit to other groups without the express permission of the original poster. Especially do not share to any shaming forums, or in order to be negative about or mock anyone.\n**11. Use that report button:** \n* If you feel a post is in violation of any of the rules, or is inappropriate content, please click the report button underneath the post or comment. \n---\n**The Mods.** If you need help please [send us a message.](http://goo.gl/5xlujx) **All posts from new users or users with negative karma are held for mod approval.**\n---\nHere's a list of [Helpful Wedding Websites](http://goo.gl/PQt7Il)\n---\n**FAQ Fridays!

Hàng ngày đều có một số lượng tương đối các câu hỏi liên quan đến du lịch/visa/làm việc/sinh sống tại Việt Nam của người nước ngoài trong bài sticky này. Vì thế, nếu có thể, bạn hãy giúp đỡ họ.\n4. **Tôn trọng các thành viên.** Không phân biệt chủng tộc, kì thị giới tính, đồng tính, bài ngoại, quấy rối, kích động thù ghét hoặc tấn công vào cá nhân. r/Vietnam là nơi bạn có thể tranh luận về các chủ đề gây nhiều tranh cãi, và sự bất đồng có thể dẫn đến những cái đầu nóng. Tuy nhiên đừng bao giờ đi quá giới hạn. Người vi phạm có thể sẽ bị ban mà không thông báo trước. Không đăng hoặc tìm kiếm thông tin cá nhân bất kể đấy là thật hay giả (tên, tuổi, số điện thoại, địa chỉ, email, tài khoản mạng xã hội..v..v..).\n5. **Một tài khoản không đăng nhiều hơn hai bài viết một ngày.** Nhằm tránh việc một tài khoản đăng quá nhiều bài viết một ngày gây loãng subreddit.\n6. **Không quảng cáo và spam.** Bao gồm cả việc spam ý kiến, luận điểm của bạn. Những bài đăng vi phạm [Self Promotion Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) của Reddit sẽ bị xóa.\n7. **Bài đăng và bình luận cần đúng chủ đề.** Những bài đăng nên xoay quanh tin tức, văn hóa, con người, cuộc sống tại Việt Nam, và những gì nằm trong phạm vi của r/Vietnam cho phép. Bình luận cũng cần đúng chủ đề. Ví dụ như, đừng nhảy vào một bài đăng đang bàn luận về một món ăn để gây tranh cãi và bàn luận về chuyện chính trị. Nếu muốn, hãy tạo một bài đăng khác.\n8. **Không thay đổi tiêu đề tin tức/bài viết bên ngoài.** Không thay đổi tiêu đề của tin tức hoặc một bài viết nếu bạn đăng link của tin tức/bài viết đó lên r/Vietnam. Tiêu đề đã bị sửa, mang tính khiêu khích, không chính xác, hoặc có thể gây hiểu lầm sẽ bị xóa. Nếu bạn muốn đưa ra ý kiến của mình về tin tức/bài viết đó thì hãy đăng vào phần comment.\n9. **Không hỏi về những thứ luật pháp không cho phép.** Bao gồm chất gây nghiện, mại dâm,..v..v..\n10. **Không bàn luận các chủ đề chính trị.**\n11. **Meme Monday.** Thứ Hai là ngày bạn có thể đăng Meme. Meme nên có liên quan tới Việt Nam và tiêu đề của bài đăng nên rõ ràng để mọi người đều hiểu. Không đăng các Meme nhằm mục đích gây kích động, thù ghét, hoặc theo đuổi các cuộc tranh cãi.\n12. Nếu bài đăng hoặc comment của bạn không hiển thị thì hãy [gửi tin nhắn cho đội ngũ mod](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FVietNam) hoặc [gửi trực tiếp tin nhắn cho t0dt0d](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=t0dt0d).\n---\n###**English:**\n1. r/Vietnam **is a dual-language subreddit.** You can use both English and Vietnamese here.\n2. **Low effort submissions.** Off-topic and low-effort submissions (memes) will be removed at the moderators' discretion.\n3. **Post your general/travel/visa questions in the sticky thread for questions.** Unless your question's intention is to create a discussion, keep it to the sticky questions thread. Most travel/visa questions should be kept there also. Please don't post your questions outside of this thread as they will be removed.\n4. **Be civil.** This means no racism / homophobia / xenophobia / sexism / hatemongering / harassment / personal attacks on other users. Seriously we shouldn't have to explain this. It's okay to discuss controversial topics, you can argue, and you can get into heated disagreements, but don't cross the line. Discrimination due to gender, race, national origin, religion, etc. will not be tolerated and is a bannable offense. No questions asked. Also no doxxing please. Do not post or seek any real or fake personal information (examples include: full names, phone numbers, email addresses, or social media accounts). Shaming or compromising pics must be anonymized.\n5. **Avoid posting more than 2 posts per day.** No flooding of posts. In order to prevent any user from flooding the subreddit, excessively (more than two in 24 hours) posting is prohibited. Spamming posts that don't provide sufficient and additional information may lead to a 30-day ban on the poster. Posts will be removed at the moderator's discretion.\n6. **No spam or self promotion.** Including spamming your opinions. Don't do that. Submissions violating the spirit of Reddit's [self promotion guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) will be removed. As a general rule, we usually do not allow travel blogs/vlogs as they are almost always posted in violation of these guidelines.\n7. **Posts \u0026amp; comments should be on-topic.** Posts \u0026amp; comments should be about news, culture, people, and life in Vietnam. Basically anything Vietnam related. Posts may be removed if linked content is not specifically about Vietnam. Comments also need to stay on topic. For example, don't hijack a highly-upvoted food photo post with unrelated political conversations.\n8. **Don't editorialize news posts.** When linking to news articles, please use the original title, or a straightforward and accurate one of your own. Editorialized, provocative, inaccurate, sensationalist, and/or misleading titles may result in the removal of the post. If you have an opinion about the article you are submitting, please post it in the comments instead.\n9. **Don't post content or ask questions about illegal things.** Drugs, prostitution, etc., are not allowed.\n10. No political discussions.\n11. **Meme Monday.** Memes should only be posted on Mondays. Memes should be directly related to Vietnam. Descriptive titles should be used. Memes should not incite rage, hate, brigading or otherwise be constructed for the sole purpose of chasing controversy.\n12. **Please message us or better send direct pm to a mod if your post or comment doesn't show up.** Message us [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FVietNam) or [send the mod t0dt0d a direct pm](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=t0dt0d)."},{"display_name":"Coffee","description":"##Welcome to Reddit's coffee community.##\nWe're equal parts a passionate horde of amiable amateurs and the back room lounge of the coffee industry.

This is not the sub to speculate on someone's sexuality. You will be banned, no exceptions.\n10. No linking or sharing of illegally hosted content: This should be obvious. Linking to Tamra Tattles, Reality tea, MeadiaTakeout, The Blast, and TwoJudgeyGirls are also NOT allowed. Do not copy and paste info from these blogs (because you can't link to them) as it violates copyright law. Please note that doing so may result in a ban.\n*We reserve the right to moderate at our own discretion.*\n_________\n[**CHECK OUT OUR WIKI PAGE FOR RULES \u0026amp; MORE INFO**](https://www.reddit.com/r/BravoRealHousewives/wiki/meta/help)\n-------------------------\n[**BravoRealHousewives Show Rankings**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZHxr0-jDeiliaQOG5ecnNr5SfW3DiA754LW2PQqFEN0/edit#responses)\n------------------------------\n[Bravolebrity Social Media Links](https://www.reddit.com/r/BravoRealHousewives/wiki/index#wiki_real_housewives_social_media_links)\n-------------------------\n[GIF Mega Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BravoRealHousewives/comments/48xnf1/rbravorealhousewives_gif_mega_thread/)\n-----------------------\n[Sidebar Picture Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BravoRealHousewives/comments/4397va/sidebar_picture_thread/)\n--------------------------\n[Yolanda Lyme disease Sub Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/BravoRealHousewives/wiki/index#wiki_yolanda_foster.2Fhadid_lyme_disease.2Fpost_treatment_lyme_disease.2Fchronic_lyme_disease_resources)\n--------------------------\n**SHOW POSTS RELATED TO:**\n[Atlanta](/r/BravoRealHousewives/search?q=flair%3A%27Atlanta%27\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n[Below Deck](/r/BravoRealHousewives/search?q=flair%3A%27Below%20Deck%27\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n[Beverly Hills](/r/BravoRealHousewives/search?q=flair%3A%27Beverly%20Hills%27\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n[Bravo](/r/BravoRealHousewives/search?q=flair%3A%27Bravo%27\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n[Dallas](/r/BravoRealHousewives/search?q=flair%3A%27Dallas%27\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n[Discussion](/r/BravoRealHousewives/search?q=flair%3A%27Discussion%27\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n[Housewives Related](/r/BravoRealHousewives/search?q=flair%3A%27Housewives%20Related%27\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n[Melbourne](/r/BravoRealHousewives/search?q=flair%3A%27Melbourne%27\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n[New Jersey](/r/BravoRealHousewives/search?q=flair%3A%27New+Jersey%27\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n[Salt Lake City](https://old.reddit.com/r/BravoRealHousewives/search?sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;q=flair%3ASalt%2BLake%2BCity)\n[New York](/r/BravoRealHousewives/search?q=flair%3A%27New%20York%27\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n[Orange County](/r/BravoRealHousewives/search?q=flair%3A%27Orange%20County%27\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n[Other Shows](/r/BravoRealHousewives/search?q=flair%3A%27Other%20Shows%27\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n[Potomac](/r/BravoRealHousewives/search?q=flair%3A%27Potomac%27\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n[Southern Charm](/r/BravoRealHousewives/search?q=flair%3A%27Southern%20Charm%27\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n[Vanderpump Rules](/r/BravoRealHousewives/search?q=flair%3A%27Vanderpump%20Rules%27\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n--------------------------\n**HOUSEWIVES SHOW INFO:**\n[Check out our Wiki Page!](https://www.reddit.com/r/BravoRealHousewives/wiki/index)"},{"display_name":"China","description":"######Welcome to /r/China. Reddit is driven by user submitted content. If you want to improve the sub, make a contribution!\n##Welcome to /r/China\nIf you are new, please read our sub rules and guidelines prior to posting and/or commenting. For commonly answered questions, please search the subreddit as your question most likely has already been answered. \n \n**User Flair**: You can select flair to indicate your nationality by clicking *edit* above. \n \n##Sub Rules\n- **R1: Be respectful.** No directed offensive language or personal attacks are allowed. Profanity is allowed, but not if it’s directed at others. Racism, sexism, and slurs or similar remarks are not allowed in either English or Chinese, including in usernames.\n- **R2: No bad faith behavior.** Bad faith behavior can include combative argumentation or statements intended to disrupt others’ points of view rather than engaging with them, attempts to provoke others into being caustic, making derisive remarks that add little value, or otherwise participating in discussions to the detriment of others. Making extreme unsubstantiated claims or sharing materials that are low in substance but high in outrage may also lead to removal.\n- **R3: Media policy.** Memes, images, videos, gifs, and other types of media are allowed but are strictly moderated. Media regarding real life people and events should provide appropriately sourced background context or risk deletion. On a spectrum from daily life musings to cultural commentary to political soapboxing, moderation of media will tighten. Media concerning topics that have already been discussed at length will likely be deleted. See also r/ChinaMemes\n- **R4: Post title policy.** Posts with low-effort, editorialized, provocative, inaccurate, sensationalist, or misleading titles will be removed and may result in a ban. In addition, posts linking to news articles or other third-party content in English must match the title of the original source or will be removed.\n- **R5: No reposts / One post per topic.** When posting about current events or new developments, please check if there are already other submissions on the topic. We regularly delete subsequent posts about the same topic, even if they provide additional information or context. If you would like to share additional information about something that has already been posted, please do so as a comment in the original thread.\n- **R6: Posts must be related to China.** Content that is only tangentially or incidentally related to China will generally be deleted.\n- **R7: Submit the best source format.** Submissions should be of the best available source format. For example, twitter posts should be submitted as links, not as screenshots. If your post is removed for this reason, you may resubmit it after appropriately selecting a better format.\n- **R8: No meta-drama or subreddit drama.** References to other subreddits that tend to cause drama, or contain Reddit Content Policy violations or other issues such as hate speech or misinformation, will likely be removed. Posts about bans or removals on other subreddits are not allowed.\n- **R9: Posts with “(Serious)” flair are held to higher standards.** \n- **R10: Daily posting limit.** Please do not make more than 3 posts per 24 hour period. Posts exceeding the limit are automatically removed, and repeated violations will result in an automated ban.\n- **R11: If posting in Chinese, please translate at least the post title / 规则11：如果发布中文贴子，请至少将标题翻译成英文**\nFor more detailed information, or examples pertaining to our rules, please click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/g0yjqx/read_rules_in_sidebar_before_posting/)\n##Other Guidelines\n- Got a question? Have you googled it and checked our [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/China/wiki) yet?\n- Post Chinese translation requests to /r/translator \n \n- The best place for travel advice is still /r/travel or /r/travelchina but if you must post here, be clear and specific as we are not itinerary planners.\n- [VISA FAQ HERE](http://lawandborder.com/faq-new-china-visa-law/). Please submit visa questions to /r/ChinaVisa. \n- No advertising or blog spam.\n- Do not create alt accounts for the purpose of attacking another user. \n \n- Positive karma is required to post or comment on /r/China.\n- **If your post does not show up, please message the mods.**\n##Other Helpful Subs\n- **Living in China:**\n /r/taobao\n- **Travel planning:** \n/r/travel \n/r/travelchina\n- **Regional Subreddits:** \n/r/shanghai \n/r/beijing \n/r/shenzhen \n/r/guangzhou \n/r/chongqing \n/r/suzhou \n/r/chengdu \n/r/hongkong \n/r/taiwan \n/r/macau \n/r/dalian \n/r/wuhan \n/r/nanjing \n/r/harbin_china\n- **Translation/Language:** \n/r/translator \n/r/chineselanguage \n/r/learnmandarin \n/r/cantonese \n/r/chinesereddit\n- **Teaching abroad:** \n/r/TEFL\n- **Hiring/Looking for Work:** \n/r/chinajobs \n* **History** \n/r/chinesehistory \n- **Art, Culture, \u0026amp; Entertainment:** \n/r/chinaart \n/r/chinapics \n/r/chinesefood \n/r/cpop \n/r/shufa \n/r/ChinaFuturism \n* **Sport** \n/r/ChineseSoccer \n \n* **Discussion** \n/r/chinabookclub \n/r/chinesepolitics \n /r/chinabiz \n/r/chinalaw \n* **For global politics** \n \n /r/worldnews\n \n \nPlease [send us a message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FChina) and let us know what you're thinking."},{"display_name":"CFB","description":"\r\n|||||||||||||\r\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\r\n||||||[](/r/CFB/)|[](/r/CFB/)||||[Scoreboard](https://scoreboard.redditcfb.com)|[](/r/CFB/comments/11g6adl/2023_rcfb_tech_challenge/)|\r\n|[](/r/CFB/w/virginia)|[](/r/CFB/w/stanford)|[](/r/CFB/w/texas)|[](/r/CFB/w/indiana)|[](/r/CFB/w/tennessee)|[](/r/cfb)|[](/r/cfb)|[](/r/CFB/w/florida)|[](/r/CFB/w/louisville)|[](/r/CFB/w/california)|[](/r/CFB/w/michigan)|[](/r/CFB/w/northcarolinastate)|\n||||||[](/r/cfb/new)|[](/r/cfb)||||||\r\n\r\n#### [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com?header) [Rules/FAQ](/r/CFB/wiki/rules?header) [Announcements](http://goo.gl/1UZb2y?header) [Filter](/r/CFB/wiki/linkflair?header) [Twitter](http://twitter.com/redditCFB?header) [Social Media](/r/CFB/wiki/socialmedia?header) [Poll/Pick 'Em](/r/CFB/wiki/poll?header) [Team Guide](/r/CFB/wiki/teamguide?header) [Awards](/r/CFB/wiki/awards?header) [Merchandise](/r/CFB/wiki/merchandise?header) [Amazon Referrals](http://goo.gl/kXKBTo?header)\r\n\r\n## [Select Flair](https://flair.redditcfb.com/)\r\n\r\n* [Links](/r/CFB)\r\n* [Amazon Referral Link to Fund Prizes](http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8\u0026amp;camp=1789\u0026amp;creative=390957\u0026amp;linkCode=ur2\u0026amp;tag=rCFB-20)\r\n* [NCAA Rules](http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/FR19.pdf)\r\n* [CFB Stats](http://www.CFBstats.com)\r\n* [New to /r/CFB?

We envision this subreddit as the philosophical counterpart to /r/AskHistorians, which is well-known for its high quality answers to historical questions.\n/r/askphilosophy is thus a place to ask and answer philosophical questions. \nPlease have a look at our [rules and guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/wiki/guidelines).\n**/r/askphilosophy is not a debate or discussion subreddit.**\nCheck our **[FAQs for a list of frequently asked questions](/r/askphilosophyFAQ)** to see if your question has already been answered. Also check the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/) and [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://www.iep.utm.edu/).\n#####Questions on /r/askphilosophy should be:\n* Distinctly philosophical (i.e. not merely tangentially related to philosophy)\n* Specific enough to reasonably be answered (i.e. not extremely broad to the point of unanswerability)\n* Posed in good faith (i.e. not posed for an agenda)\n* Questions about philosophy, e.g. arguments in philosophy, philosophers' positions, the state of the field (not questions about commenters' opinions)\n#####Answers on /r/askphilosophy should be:\n* Substantive and well-researched (i.e. not one-liners or otherwise uninformative)\n* Accurately portray the state of research and literature (i.e. not inaccurate or false)\n* Come only from [panelists](https://old.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/wiki/panelists), i.e. those with relevant knowledge of the question (i.e. not from commenters who don't understand the state of the research on the question)\n#####Comments other than answers on /r/askphilosophy should be one of the following:\n* Follow-up questions related to the OP's question\n* Follow-up questions to a particular answer\n* Discussion of the accuracy of a particular answer\n* Thanks, gratitude, etc. for a particular answer.\nAll other comments are off-topic and will be removed.\n###Rules\nYou can find a full list of the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/wiki/rules).\n###Panelists and Flair\nOnly panelists are allowed to answer questions on /r/askphilosophy, whether those answers are made as top level comments or as replies to other comments. /r/askphilosophy panelists are trusted commenters who have applied to become panelists in order to help provide answers to posters' questions. These panelists are volunteers who have some level of knowledge and expertise in the areas of philosophy indicated by their flair.\nUnlike in some subreddits, the purpose of flair on r/askphilosophy is not to designate commenters' areas of interest. The purpose of flair is to indicate commenters' relevant expertise in philosophical areas. As philosophical issues are often complicated and have potentially thousands of years of research to sift through, knowing when someone is an expert in a given area can be important in helping understand and weigh the given evidence. Flair is given to those with the relevant research expertise.\nYou can find the details of our panelist system [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/wiki/panelists).

The purpose of this subreddit is to discuss FI/RE strategies, techniques, and lifestyles whether you are retired or not.\n**FI/RE is about:**\n* Discovering and achieving life goals: “What would I do with my life if I didn't have to work for money?\"\n* Simplifying and redesigning your lifestyle to reduce spending. Your wants and needs aren't written in stone, and less spending is powerful at any income level.\n* Working to increase your income and income streams with projects, side-gigs, and additional effort\n* Striving to save a large percentage (usually more than 50%) of your income to accelerate achieving FI\n* Investing to make your money work for you, and learning to manage/optimize those investments for the unique nature of FI/RE\n* Retiring Early\n**FI/RE is NOT about:**\n* Gaining wealth for the purpose of excessive consumption\n* Taking the slow road, or the traditional road to retirement\nBecoming financially independent requires hard work and a healthy attitude towards money, but also a degree of privilege.

Be it Steam, Epic, Origin, Ubisoft Connect, GOG, Xbox, Playstation, or Nintendo Consoles, we will find every last free Game and DLC we can, and get it to you!\n#Rules\n**Be Respectful**. Toxic behaviour isn't wanted on FGF. The assumption before was that it wouldn't need to be said. While it should be common sense, it's now written out. Just be cool, we're all just hanging out!\n1. **No Free To Play Games Or Free Weekends**. We don't allow games that are always free (i.e. TF2 or Dota 2) or basic free weekends on Steam. Only post games that *normally have a price, but are temporarily free to claim and kept forever.* The **forever** part is important.\n On top of that, we also allow free games (that are newer or older offers) that will give '+1' to your steam game count.\n We do *currently* allow Alpha/Beta threads for F2P games. On that note though, the Alpha/Beta has to be acquirable through abnormal means in some way. (So not just \"buying\" on the steam store etc.) \n2. **The Giveaway Has To Be Open To Many.** A safe bet for amount of keys/codes being given away is *1000*. A little lower than that can be cool too, but be reasonable. We do allow raffles here, but they have to be pretty easy to 'fix'. If they're just normal raffles, we currently allow 10k+ key raffles, as they're pretty open. Ala Steamgifts. Something like maybe refreshing/trying again in a minute is safest. Also people should be 99% guaranteed to get access to this item, so no *sign up to possibly get in* type things.\n3. **Follow Our Format**. We, or the Automoderator will remove incorrectly posted threads. \n The format is as follows;\n [Platform] (Game, DLC, Membership, Credit, Alpha/Beta, Alpha, Beta, Software, Demo or Other) *title of free item*. Leave the words 'Free' and 'Giveaway' out of the title, also don't have 'Beta' outside of brackets. No other stuff either. Just the three noted sections above. \n We accept most platforms and DRMs (GoG, Steam, Epic, Uplay, Console, general PC, and other platforms that exist) that has gaming, however the item in \"()\" must be a Game, DLC, Membership, Credit, or Other.\n DLC/Other posts should label the game name before the item name: [Platform] (DLC) Game Name - DLC Name\n4. **Do Not Trade, Beg or Post Referral Links**. We don't allow you to trade games here, we don't want you spamming referral-links of any kind. We also ask that you don't blatantly beg for things, most goodies are very simple to acquire. Even if they're not, just don't do it. We call it begging as a deterrent, but no matter how nicely or politely you're asking, it's still not acceptable. No asking for keys without someone offering first.\n5. **Don't Promote Key Farming**. So this is a little issue we've seen here and there. Please refrain from getting more keys for a single game offer. Or at least don't tell people about it. It's not a good thing to do. However I think there's an exception to this. If you're discussing how an offer includes numerous games, and that you're able to try to get those others ones as well, then I don't think it's a problem. Just don't discuss you getting a bunch of one game.\n6. **Use Link Flair**. Say there's steps to getting the item, list/walkthrough them in the comments of your thread, then flair it as 'Read Comments'. Does the post require social media? Use that flair. Has it expired? Please flair it as such, this is the most helpful flair to use.\n7. **Only Post Offers When They're Live**. If the offer you're posting isn't available yet, or is scheduled for later, it can't be posted. There can be exceptions for times where you need to do something prior to prepare or something like that. In cases like that, post a **[PSA]** and ask mods to approve the post. You can also use the pinned discussion thread to inform.\n8. **Prior Work Sites Are Allowed**. Giveaways that require prior work or participation on certain sites are allowed. \"Prior work\" refers to tasks like playtime in a game demo, accumulating points, completing daily activities, or reaching specific tiers on a site before you can access the giveaway. These giveaways are allowed as long as they don’t require spending real money. \n For cases where these sorts of requirements are present, those posting them should edit the flair of the post to include an estimate of the time required. You could further elaborate on the requirements in the comments, but should have some sort of inclusion in the flair for immediate information to users.\n9. ~~**No Mobile Games**. We don't allow mobile games (Android, iOS, or Windows Phone) to be posted here. Please look below for other subreddits you can post those on.~~ EDIT: We will be testing allowing \"highlight\" items being posted like normal to the subreddit. All other items should be posted in the Exiled mega thread for the time being.\n10. **Alpha/Beta Offers Cannot Be Short Timed Test Periods**. This means no test weekends/weeks. If the timed obsolescence is too short, it's not really fitting. As of right now these general limited time Beta offers aren't allowed, at least not without a reward of some kind. Even then it should be noted that the post would be best as being done for the reward alone rather than the beta. *(Other) Game Beta - Tester Reward* \n11. **Mega Threads for Itch.io and \"Exiled\" Offers**.

All posts must be relevant to the Warriors.\n2. All links to Reddit posts outside of /r/warriors need to be in no-participation mode. [https://np.reddit.com](https://np.reddit.com)\n3. If you want to make a \"Meta\" post, you need to message modmail first asking for permission. \"Meta\" is defined as about the subreddit or its members.\n4. Upvote Parties, a.k.a \"Arrow Fiestas\", are not allowed. The moderators will post them occasionally, so look out for them!**4. Do not vote if you are not subscribed.\n5. Be civil. Regardless of the scenario, all posts and comments are subject to removal. Personal attacks, trolling, toxicity, and bigotry will result in bans. Do not be a jerk and use your better judgment. a. Visiting the subreddit of another team to troll or antagonize them will result in a ban from /r/warriors. Non-Warriors fans engaging in this type of behavior will also be banned. Be civil and use your better judgment just as you would here. b. Do not link to or post screenshots of other subreddits for the sole purpose of brigading, vote manipulation, or to attack their fan base or specific users. c. Posting about bans obtained from other subreddits will result in a ban here as well.\n6. No personal information. Posting or seeking any identifying personal information will result in a ban without a prior warning. This includes yourself and other people, and refers to, but is not limited to, names, phone numbers, email addresses, FaceBook, or other social media accounts. Again, we will not hesitate to enforce this rule. This rule protects both the OP (original poster) and the /r/warriors community from any harm. No exceptions will be made.\n7. Any post that exists solely to congratulate the Warriors originating from a fan of another team will be removed at the discretion of the moderation team.\n8. Moderators reserve the right to remove content or restrict posting privileges of users as necessary if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.\n9. Here at /r/warriors we do not endorse the selling and purchasing of tickets to Warriors games. Any ticket sales, purchases, or exchanges etc. are done completely at the risk of the buyer and seller.\n10. Posts with clickbait or sensationalized titles will be removed and repeat offenses will be subject to ban. Clickbait titles are defined as titles whose main purpose is to attract attention and encourage visitors to click on a link to a particular web page, that are either an exaggeration of the specific piece/quote or have nothing to do with it entirely.\n11. No self-promotion for non-contributors. This applies to podcasts, videos, blog posts, \u0026amp; etc. Any user who wants to self-promote must have a reasonable post and comment history in this subreddit that is not related to whatever the user is trying to promote.\n12. When posting news or information always include the source either as a link post or in the body. Make sure to always post the original source, not an aggregation. When submitting tweets please include the content of the tweet in the title of the post in \"[Author] Tweet\" format. When submitting paywalled articles post them as text posts with a link to the article and 1-3 quoted excerpts or a bulleted list of topics covered.**Please contact modmail for any clarification.*\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n|**2024-25 WARRIORS ROSTER**|\n:--:|:--:\n\\#|Name|Pos.|Exp.\n:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:\n00 | [Jonathan Kuminga](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/k/kuminjo01.html) | F | 4\n1 | [Taran Armstrong](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/armstta02.html) | G | R\n0 | [Gary Payton II](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/paytoga02.html) | G | 8\n2 | [Brandin Podziemski](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/podzibr01.html) | G | 2\n4 | [Moses Moody](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/moodymo01.html) | G | 4\n5 | [Kevon Looney](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/looneke01.html) | C | 9\n7 | [Buddy Hield](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hieldbu01.html) | G | 8\n10 | [Jimmy Butler](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/butleji01.html) | F | 13\n12 | [Braxton Key](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/k/keybr01.html) | F | 3\n15 | [Gui Santos](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/santogu01.html) | F | 1\n21 | [Quinten Post](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/postqu01.html) | C | R\n23 | [Draymond Green](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/greendr01.html) | F | 12\n30 | [Stephen Curry](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01.html) | G | 15\n31 | [Kevin Knox](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/k/knoxke01.html) | F | 6\n32 | [Trayce Jackson-Davis](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jackstr02.html) | C | 2\n44 | [Jackson Rowe](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/roweja01.html) | F | R\n61 | [Pat Spencer](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/spencpa01.html) | G | 1\n###**Official Warriors Links**\n[](http://www.nba.com/warriors/)\n[](https://www.instagram.com/warriors/)\n[](https://www.facebook.com/warriors)\n[](https://twitter.com/warriors)\n[](https://www.youtube.com/user/GoldenStateWarriors/videos)\n[](https://soundcloud.com/warriors)\n[](http://www.nba.com/gamenotes//warriors.pdf)\n---\n###**Related Subreddits**\n[](https://tinyurl.com/y6wvyefx)\n[](https://tinyurl.com/y99t8vwd)\n[](https://tinyurl.com/y5ktt3ku)\n[](https://tinyurl.com/ybno4ugn)\n[](https://tinyurl.com/y9posua5)\n[](https://tinyurl.com/y7ewmevb)\n[](https://tinyurl.com/ycb2dkoh)\n###### \n**[1947ChampionshipBanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1946-47_Philadelphia_Warriors_season)**\n**[1956ChampionshipBanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1955-56_Philadelphia_Warriors_season)**\n**[1975ChampionshipBanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974-75_Golden_State_Warriors_season)**\n**[2015ChampionshipBanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014–15_Golden_State_Warriors_season)**\n**[2017ChampionshipBanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016–17_Golden_State_Warriors_season)**\n**[2018ChampionshipBanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017–18_Golden_State_Warriors_season)**\n**[2022ChampionshipBanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021-22_Golden_State_Warriors_season)**\n[](https://www.instagram.com/p/BVnBpAIB4_t/)"},{"display_name":"airsoft","description":"A subreddit devoted to the discussion of airsoft guns, gear and advice.\nSo please stop making more. \n**If your post isn't appearing check that it isn't breaking any subreddit or site-wide rules.

Do not offer to message someone to help them. This rule exists to help prevent scams.\n5. **No joke or meme posts.**\n There are other communities with millions of subscribers dedicated to memes and humor. There is no need for it to be here. If you want memes and humor on Reddit, check out r/funny or r/memes.\n6. **No NSFW content.**\n This is a safe for work community. If you have a tech support problem that is related to NSFW (such as \"why am I seeing NSFW ads on my feed\"), you can describe the issue in text. Do not post a screenshot of the content. STOP POSTING PORN! PERMA BAN\n7. **No hate speech, trolling or harassment.**\n Do not insult others, or post hateful content. This is a tech support and discussion community.\n8. **Follow [reddiquette](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette) and the reddit [Terms of Service](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement-september-12-2021).**\n These rules must be followed in all subreddits, and this one is no exception.\n9. **Adhere to post title guidelines.**\n Your post title should not look like it was written by a twelve-year old. We have a character limit for a reason, and attempting to bypass this will result in a perma ban. THERE IS NO NEED TO YELL, and your title should not be any form of clickbait whatsoever.\n**Posting anything against the rules will get you a minimum of a three day ban.**\n_____\n*\"Facebook\" and \"Meta\" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Meta Platforms.

High quality on-topic posts ONLY.**\nHigh-quality posts help solve specific beauty-related problems. Low-quality posts clutter the subreddit and tend to be repetitive. Examples of low-quality posts: “What is my [face shape, eye shape, skintone]?”, glow up requests, compliment fishing, non-beauty advice, sympathy farming, attention seeking, rage-bait, politics, \"pretty privilege\", and vague-titled posts.\nFor more examples of low quality/off-topic posts, please visit the [/r/beauty wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/wiki/index/).\n**2. NO SPAM.**\nNO spam allowed. No surveys. No links to your own blog posts or social media accounts. No YouTube videos. No promotional websites. No link codes. No porn. NO SELF PROMOTIONS! NO SPAM ACCOUNTS. (Yes, some brand accounts and porn accounts count as spam too.) No AI/ChatGPT.\nDo not repost removed or self-deleted content.\n**3. Self posts and pictures are allowed as long as they're your own content.**\nSelf posts and pictures are acceptable, but should be your own content (or give credit to the source) and be useful to the community. Links to YouTube and TikTok videos are not permitted.\n**4. NO PORN.**\nWe are not an 18+ subreddit. We're counting porn (and similar posts) as spam and instant-ban worthy. Posts or comments with porn, nudity, toplessness, privates showing, only fans promotions, and the like will be removed. Commenters/posters that violate this rule will be banned. Please report any porn-related content that you see.\n**5. Harassment of other users and mods can get you banned. Permanently.**\nWe enforce Reddit’s site-wide rules. Rude, offensive, judgmental, sexualized/thirsty, and generally mean comments or posts will be removed and the user risks being banned at the mods' discretion. Please report any comments or posts that fit this description so we can act accordingly.\nAny harassment outside of comments/posts will be treated on a case-by-case basis.\nDo not attempt to contact mods through any means other than official modmail. Any misuse of modmail will be considered harassment.\n**6. Moderator discretion.**\nModerators reserve the right to make decisions in the best interests of the sub and its users, including removing posts that are overly dramatic or are deemed likely to cause undue drama or controversy. Posts that are low effort, repetitive, or have insufficient detail (i.e., just a photo) may be removed. If you won't make the effort to tell us what your question is, we won't make the effort to try to guess.\nAttempting to evade filters for any reason is a bannable offense."},{"display_name":"visualnovels","description":"###[](/r/visualnovels/wiki/weeklythreadsschedule2022)\n###[](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/search?q=%22Untranslated+Visual+Novels+Thread+-%22\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n###[](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/search?q=%22Untranslated+Visual+Novels+Thread+-%22\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n**[Go HERE to set your flair.](/r/visualnovels/wiki/selectflair)** \n(last updated on Aug 13, 2022)\n---\nThis is a community for discussing visual novels.

Play it safe.\n *Always* use spoiler tags in threads that are not about one specific VN. The only exceptions are series (e.g. Ace Attorney), but only if OP makes it clear that discussing all games in a series without spoiler tags is okay.\n* **How to use spoiler tags**:\n Hide spoilers like this: \\\u0026gt;!hidden spoilery text!\u0026lt; which shows up as \u0026gt;!hidden spoilery text!\u0026lt;. Make sure there are no spaces at the beginning and end of the spoiler tag because this will break it for users on http://old.reddit.com/. In other words do this: \u0026gt;!properly hidden spoiler!\u0026lt;, but not this: \u0026gt;! broken spoiler tag !\u0026lt;\n* **Furigana**:\n To use furigana in your posts, use the following syntax:\n \\[正義の味方](#fg \"せいぎのみかた\")\n which will display [正義の味方](#fg \"せいぎのみかた\") on old Reddit. The quotation marks are not optional.\n##Submitting a post\n* **Announcements:**\n If a VNDB page for a newly announced VN is available, make sure to post it in the comments when you've submitted the post.\n* **NSFW**:\n *After* submitting, mark the submission with the NSFW tag if unhidden 18+ material is contained in the post. \n* **Unallowed Posts**:\n No non-VN related submissions, no reposts from within under a year, no low-effort submissions. [Details](/r/visualnovels/wiki/rules).\n* **Images**:\n Images, Screenshots, and Memes related to Visual Novels are currently fine to post. Just make sure to space out your posts in moderation. If you post a screenshot, you are required to post a name of the visual novel in the title as well as tagging the topic with spoilers.\n* **Self-promotion, crowdfunding, and Kickstarters**:\n Make sure topic title has Visual Novel name, make sure Project has narration and emphasis on reading, make sure updates are only major milestones, space out new asset/poll updates once every 2 weeks. [Details here.](/r/visualnovels/wiki/rules)\n* **Giveaways \u0026amp; selling stuff**:\n Giveaway and selling posts are fine. Just make sure to post some kind of picture proof if selling anything physical. [Tips here.](/r/visualnovels/wiki/rules)\n##General\n* **Piracy**:\n Don't ask for or link to illegal downloads, don't mention sites where illegal downloads are hosted, and don't encourage illegal downloading. Translation patches are allowed.\n* **Non-VN related threads**\n Submissions unrelated to VNs are discouraged. Use the weekly Off-topic threads or the Weekly Question threads for personal things like saying hello, thanks, goodbye, or asking to be Steam friends. News about VN adaptions is allowed.\n* **18+ Content**\n We welcome discussion about VNs containing 18+ content, but please bear in mind that this subreddit itself is not marked NSFW, and the focus of this subreddit is on VNs with some sort of literary value. Discussion of VNs with no literary value and with a large focus on 18+ content would be better suited to r/eroge.\n\u0026gt;#####Useful Links\n\u0026gt;[**VNDB** - Visual Novel Database](http://vndb.org)\n\u0026gt;[**Visual Novels General Wiki**](http://visual-novels-general.wikia.com/wiki/Visual_Novels_General_Wiki)\n\u0026gt;[**Buying VNs**](/r/visualnovels/wiki/buy)\n\u0026gt;[**Subreddit rules**](/r/visualnovels/wiki/rules)\n\u0026gt;[**More**](/r/visualnovels/wiki/links)\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\u0026gt;#####Guides\n\u0026gt;[**Guide to Japanese**](http://tinyurl.com/guidetojp)\n\u0026gt;[**Technical problems**](/r/visualnovels/wiki/problems)\n\u0026gt;[**Text Hookers** - guide for handling untranslated VNs](/r/visualnovels/wiki/vnhooking)\n\u0026gt;[**Terminology**](http://visual-novels-general.wikia.com/wiki/Japanese_Terminology)\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\u0026gt;#####Related Communities\n\u0026gt;[**Visual Novel Subreddits**](/r/visualnovels/wiki/links#wiki_related_subreddits)\n\u0026gt;[**4chan /vn/**](https://boards.4channel.org/vg/catalog#s=/vn/)\n\u0026gt;[**itch.io** - Following Developers](https://itch.io/)\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\u0026gt;#####Filters\n\u0026gt;[**Discussion only**](/r/visualnovels/search?sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;q=flair%3ADiscussion)\n\u0026gt;[**News and Releases only**](/r/visualnovels/search?q=flair%3ARelease+OR+flair%3ANews\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;include_over_18=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n\u0026gt;[**Images only**](/r/visualnovels/search?sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;q=flair%3AImage)\n---\nSee [here](http://tt.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/) to hide the menu bar.\n####[](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/search?q=%22Update%2FDiscussion+-%22\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all \"Image: Process of Elimination\") [](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/search?q=%22Weekly+Discussion+%22\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all \"Image: Ef a fairy tale of two, eden* -they were only two on the planet\") [](https://old.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/search?q=%22What+are+you+reading%3F%22\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all \"Image: Hanachirasu\") [](https://old.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/search?q=%22Weekly+Threads%2C+Questions%2C+and+Recommendations+Megathread%22\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all \"Image: Sakura no Kumo * Scarlet no Koi\") [](https://old.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/search?q=%22Weekly+Threads%2C+Questions%2C+and+Recommendations+Megathread%22\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all \"Image: Narcissu\")\n####\u0026amp;nbsp;\n####\u0026amp;nbsp;\n####\u0026amp;nbsp;\n####\u0026amp;nbsp;\n#####[Compact Mode](https://cm.reddit.com/r/visualnovels 'Flairs too big for you?

We are not affiliated with the airline, and there is a pretty good chance no one that works for the airline will be reading your posts here. With that said, here are a couple of rules.\nRule 1. Treat everyone with courtesy and respect\nMany will post their gripes with AA here, and to some of the more seasoned flyers these gripes will seem like obvious user errors. All participants must treat each other with respect, even if there are differing viewpoints or opinions on certain topics. Personal attacks, name calling, victim blaming, or other similar attacks are explicitly forbidden. \nRule 2: \nAll content should be related to American Airlines or be travel adjacent\nThis subreddit is meant to discuss all items pertaining to American Airlines. Inherently, some non-AA but still travel adjacent content might be relevant, however the moderation team will have the final say. Politics is generally not permitted, even when it is AA related. \nRule 3:\nNo private or confidential information\nPlease do not include your name, AAdvantage number, your record locator, or any other personally identifying information. Avoid sharing personal info of others like employee names, addresses, phone numbers, and emails. Only post photos of others with clear consent; otherwise, they'll be removed.\nRule 4:\nUse sticky threads were relevant\nFrom time to time, specific threads may be pinned (or stickied) at the top of the subreddit. Additional rules relevant to those topics will be posted in those threads. Generally, if a sticky thread exists, all content relevant\tto that topic must be posted in the sticky thread. Attempts to evade automatic enforcement are expressly forbidden.\nRule 5:\nUse the search feature before posting\nThere are only so many questions that can be asked and there is a very good chance your question is not unique. Before posting a question, utilize the search feature to find answers to common inquiries. This includes topics such as pet policies, carry-on bag dimensions, and refunds, basic economy rules, and others.\nRule 6:\nComplaint/Help thread comments must actually be helpful\nFor those posting a request for help or a complaint: Your post should contain specific, unique, information pertaining to your situation and what you are specifically looking for out of your post.\nFor those providing help/commenting: Your post must contain specific, actionable suggestions that OP could take moving forward. Comments about what they should have done differently are not permitted in that thread. \nRule 7:\nAll threads must be properly flaired\nFailure to use flair might result in your post being automatically removed. In that case, please resubmit following the correct protocols.\nRule 8:\nAll reviews and complaints must be in the form of Trip Reports, and must be properly flaired\nIf you have a general complaint but aren't looking for help, your post must be flaired with the \"Trip Report\" flair. Failure to use this flair will result in your post being removed.\nAll titles must be formatted with the airport(s) at the beginning of the title. Ex: \"[JFK][LAS] POST TITLE.\" Your title will be automatically removed if you fail to do this.\nRule 9:\nAsking for someone to share their buddy pass or flight benefits (whether for free or for sale) is expressly forbidden and will result in a permanent ban. Additionally, asking for freebies (such as SWU) or asking to purchase miles or trip credits are forbidden.\nRule 10:\nNo referral codes or other method of monetization is allowed\nReferral codes (including but not limited to credit card or shopping portal bonuses) are not permitted. Additional avenues of content monetization (including linking to your advertiser supported blog or paid membership service) is not permitted."},{"display_name":"phinvest","description":"#Posting rules \n1.

Relevance.**\nPosts should be specifically related to the fatFIRE pursuit and lifestyle - as opposed to regular FIRE or LeanFIRE. Discussing investment strategies, expenses, tax strategies, cost of living, and etc. are all fair game. Please assign a post flair to your post. If one doesn't exist for your post, it's very likely that your post is not relevant to fatFIRE and risks removal. Low effort, gift advice or \"ask-a-rich-person\" posts, reposts, and cross posts from other subreddits may also be removed.\n**2. Early-stage questions belong in Mentor Monday threads.**\nThis is a community for people firmly on the path to fatFIRE or already there. Others are welcome to lurk and comment, but are encouraged to spend some time reading the sub’s historic posts if they are looking for instruction or inspiration.\nPosts related to the early stage of fatFIRE should be submitted as comments to the scheduled Mentor Monday posts. This includes career advice questions, ‘rate-my-plan’ posts and ‘can I afford XYZ?’ (Unless XYZ is a submarine - https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/ih7bcx )\n**3. No judgement.**\nComments which criticize someone simply for living a “FatFIRE” lifestyle or making a high income will be removed, and users will be muted or banned at the moderator’s discretion.\n**4. (Optional) Add verification.**\n(Optional) Add proof to your post or verify your post or account with the mods if you plan to make extraordinary claims pertaining to your fatFIRE status (inheritance amount, income, net worth, etc.). [Instructions on how to get verified can be found on the sub's FAQ.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/tp2ds9/rfatfire_frequently_asked_questions/) Verified members can flair a post 'Verified Members Only' to only receive comments from other verified members.\n**5. Be courteous and positive. No trolling**\nNo insults, name calling or harassment. No trolling or gross deception regarding your net worth, lifestyle or employment. Violators will be banned at the moderator’s discretion.\nTrolls / deceptive members should be reported to mods. Calling out other members via a top-level post is inappropriate for this sub, as is any action that is likely to result in widespread harassment against the targeted account.\n**6. No solicitation, no self promotion**\nDo not ask members to contribute to any business, investments, Venmo, GoFundMe, etc. in which you or your close associates have a stake. Charities and broad investment recommendations (e.g. index funds and management firms) can be recommended on request, but any personal involvement should be stated. Nor can you promote your own business / website / external survey / social media / blog, or share affiliate links unless specifically asked. This applies to posts, comments, and private messages."},{"display_name":"ImaginaryWarhammer","description":"#####Warhammer Fantasy and 40K art\nSee the [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryWarhammer/comments/34ty6y/rimaginarywarhammer_index_rules_flair_lore/) for questions about /r/ImaginaryWarhammer's [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryWarhammer/comments/34txjv/rimaginarywarhammers_rules/), flair, and other resources.\n---\n#####Rules ([See More](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryWarhammer/comments/34txjv/rimaginarywarhammers_rules/)): \n1. **Credit the artist in the submission title.** If you don’t, and a moderator can find artist credit, your post will be removed.

Avoid snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments) Avoid discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict. Avoid microaggressions\n## 7. Be responsible.\nWhat you say and do matters. Take responsibility for your words and actions, including their consequences, whether intended or otherwise.\n## 8. Follow the Go Code of Conduct\nAs a part of the Go community, this subreddit and those who post on it should follow the tenets laid out in the Go Code of Conduct: https://golang.org/conduct\nTreat everyone with respect and kindness. Be thoughtful in how you communicate. Don’t be destructive or inflammatory.\n## 9. Must be Go Related\nPosts must be of interest to Go developers and related to the Go language.\nThis includes: - Articles about the language itself - Announcements \u0026amp; articles about open source Go libraries or applications - Dev tools (open source or not) specifically targeted at Go developers\nWe ask that you not post about closed-source / paid software that is not specifically aimed at Go developers in particular (as opposed to all developers), even if it is written in Go.\n## 10. Do Not Post Pirated Material\nDo not post links to or instructions on how to get pirated copies of copyrighted material.\n## 11. Job Posts Go in the \"Who's Hiring?\" Post\nWe have a monthly \"Who's Hiring?\" post that will stay pinned to the top of the subreddit. To avoid too much noise from companies, please post job openings there. Please keep in mind, this is for 1st party postings only. No 3rd party recruiters.\n## 12. No GPT-generated or GPT-quality content.\nNo GPT or other AI-generated content is allowed as posts, post targets, or comments. This is only for the content itself; posts about GPT or AI related to Go are fine.\nAs GPT content is difficult to distinguish from merely low-quality content, low-quality content may be removed too. This includes but is not limited to listicles and \"Go tutorials\" that have no human voice and add nothing of their own.\n# Documentation\n* [Official Go Documentation](http://go.dev/doc)\n* [Standard Library Docs](http://pkg.go.dev/std)\n* [Other Package Docs](http://pkg.go.dev)\n# Community\n* [Go Nuts Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts)\n* [Go questions in Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/go)\n* [Resources for new Go programmers](http://dave.cheney.net/resources-for-new-go-programmers)"},{"display_name":"sandiego","description":"## *Ask your QUESTIONS HERE*\n## • ***[Ask San Diego](/r/AskSanDiego)***\n## • ***[SD Classifieds](/r/SanDiegoClassifieds)***\n## • ***[SD Jobs](/r/SanDiegoJobs)***\n-----------\n---\n# [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/SanDiego/about/rules/)\n[**Our rules and guidelines are easy**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SanDiego/about/rules/):\n---\n***Bored?***\nCheck the weekly* ***\"Things to Do\"*** *thread pinned at the top of the sub or visit the subs [Facebook Meetup Group](http://www.facebook.com/groups/sdredditors/)\n[**Feeling Depressed?** Help is here (chat)!](https://svcrplv.uhc.com/sdchat/)\n Direct Phone: **(888) 724-7240**\n[**Watch this video for some VERY GOOD Advice**](https://youtu.be/eVphvQjSJ9c)\n[**Bi-Polar, OCD** or ***something else*** you're not sure of (difficult thoughts)?](https://www.crisistextline.org) and you can also [check these people out too](http://www.dbsasandiego.org)\n---\n* [***Visiting The City*?***](https://www.sandiego.org/plan/visitors-information-services.aspx) Here's [One redditors tour experience](https://old.reddit.com/r/sandiego/comments/98cyyo/visited-sd-last-week-to-visit-family-and-had-a/)\n* [**Thinking of moving to SD?

Be Respectful; Follow Reddiquette\n* Personal attacks, racism, and hate speech will not be tolerated. Do not post hateful or hostile comments about artists, songs, or their fans. If you dislike a group, ignore threads about them. Do not post sexual comments about idols. [See Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette).\n##### 2. Follow Title Guidelines\n* Titles should be detailed, accurate, and follow our Title Formatting Guide in the Rules Page. Do not use vague titles or editorialize them without permission from moderators. Titles entirely in Korean will be removed.\n##### 3. Provide English Sources for Articles\n* English-language articles are favored. If the article is in Korean, provide a full English translation or a detailed summary in the comments at the time of posting. Machine translations not permitted.\n##### 4. No Reposts / Throwbacks / Old Media\n* Only content released within the last 30 days is allowed. Make sure that the content submission has not been posted already (No Reposts!). Throwback posts are curated by moderators on Thursdays.\n##### 5. Avoid Piracy\n* Link to officially licensed sources as often as possible. Pirated content will be removed if an official source becomes available or is likely to in the future. Any media that is obviously behind a paywall or exclusive to people who have paid/subscribed to a service are not allowed.\n##### 6. Only In-Depth Discussions\n* Discussion posts should be based on interesting or novel topics that are conversation starters. They should allow for broad participation from the community and include significant content in the original post beyond just asking a question. Mods may use discretion to allow simpler questions if they are novel/unique or are especially topical at the time.\n##### 7. No Ranting or Soapbox Posts\n* Do not use the subreddit as a platform to rant about your personal opinion on an issue. You may rant *respectfully* and start more opinionated or artist-centered discussions in r/kpoppers. Topics designed to bash artists or their fans are absolutely not allowed.\n##### 8. No Memes or Joke Posts\n* Content submitted with the intention of being humorous is restricted to the Weekly Discussion post or r/kpoppers.\n##### 9. No Fan-Made Content / Self-Promo\n* Fan-made content is restricted to r/kpoppers. For a list of allowed content, read the r/kpop ecosystem guidelines. Do not link to your own blogs, articles, or work in r/kpop. Official company/artist accounts should seek permission from the moderators before posting. \n#####10. No Buying / Selling\n* Submissions offering to buy/sell/trade merchandise or concert tickets are better suited for r/kpopforsale. We do not have affiliation with that subreddit, so use it at your own risk.\n\u0026gt;[Questions?

Rude and/or aggressive behavior will not be tolerated on this sub. All forms of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc. will be removed, possibly resulting in a ban. No attacks on URMs.\n2. **No extreme neuroticism.** This should be a wholesome place for premeds to discuss premed-related topics. Being overly neurotic is unhelpful and adds personal stress in addition to placing the burden of your stress on others.\n3. **No college admissions-related content.** This sub is primarily oriented towards undergraduate students looking to apply to MD/DO programs. Any and all posts related to the undergraduate admissions process belong on other subreddits, such as /r/ApplyingToCollege. Do not ask us if School X or School Y is better for undergrad. Do not ask us what you should major in (hint: it doesn't matter).\n4. **No common/recently posted questions or discussions.** Please read our wiki prior to posting your question. If your question is not answered in the wiki, use the search bar. We almost guarantee you're not the first person with your question. If you still can't find an answer, go ahead and create a new post.\n5. **No off-topic posts or comments.** Pre-med humor is encouraged, but please keep your memes specific to being premed. Political posts are not allowed unless explicitly related to premed. Overtly off-topic posts and comments will be removed. All MCAT-related discussion belongs in r/MCAT.\n6. **No filesharing.** Filesharing is prohibited in this subreddit. This includes discussion of filesharing or sources of pirated or copyrighted materials. Anki-related discussion belongs on /r/ankimcat, /r/medicalschoolanki, or /r/Anki. Discussion related to other resources belongs on /r/MCAT or another related sub.\n7. **No advertising/self-promotion.** Do not share links to blogs, vlogs, YouTube channels, consulting or personal websites, Discord channels, businesses, etc. Should you wish to advertise a service or product, consider buying a sponsored link from reddit. If you have a free product you believe would really help pre-med students, message the mods for prior approval to posting.\n8. **No AMA-style posts without moderator approval.** Being accepted to medical school does not make you a celebrity, nor does it grant you some higher wisdom that must be shared. AMA-style posts are not allowed without prior moderator approval.\n9. **No research/surveys without moderator approval.** Research and/or surveys are not allowed on /r/premed. You may message the moderators if you believe you deserve an exemption, but the answer will likely be no.\n10. **Use SDN school-specific threads for school-specific questions.** Any super specific question that only applies to one medical school should be asked on the Student Doctor Network school-specific thread for the school in question. The SDN school-specific threads are linked in the /r/premed sidebar. \n11. **URM / Affirmative Action.** All posts and comments on this subreddit must be respectful of other users and relevant to this subeddit's purpose. Allowed: Mentioning ORM/URM in the context of an applicant's chances or their school list. Not Allowed: Discussion of affirmative action as a concept; bashing on URMs or the concept of URMs; complaining about your status as an ORM; discussion unrelated to pre-med and/or med school admissions.\n12. **Karma / Account Age Requirement.** In order to help reduce spam on our subreddit, users must have at least 10 comment karma in order to participate on /r/premed, and all accounts must be at least 72 hours old. To gain karma, post comments on other subreddits and gain upvotes. Check out /r/FreeKarma4You if you're really desperate.\n##Resources\n**READ THE [WIKI](https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/wiki/index) BEFORE POSTING**\n- [Weekly Megathread

[Here is a brief introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/WarhammerCompetitive/comments/7phjhs/welcome_to_rwarhammercompetitive/?ref=share\u0026amp;ref_source=link) to how that applies to this sub.\nTo understand what the competitive mindset is all about, [start here](http://www.sirlin.net/articles/playing-to-win) with this article that describes what playing to win is and isn't.

Don't pretend to be someone else. Give credit if it's not your picture.\n9. **No advertising of any kind. No YouTube/Twitter/blog spam.** Refer to [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/wiki/rule10) for further info regarding this rule. Consult with the mods about promotional offers.\n10. No posting personal information of any kind. This includes linking to social media accounts that aren't yours.\n11. Posts detailing customer service issues where the online company has defrauded you are allowed. The person making the post must provide adequate proof of the story they post (ie multiple pictures of shoes purchased, screenshots of conversations you have had with reps from the company etc). In cases that seem suspect or proof is not provided we will lock commenting on the post and sticky our reasoning. The thread can be unlocked by adding more proof.\n##Filters##\n[](#specialbutton)[Hide Checks](http://sn.reddit.com/r/sneakers/#sn)[](#rightalign)[](#specialbutton)[WDYWT](http://wd.reddit.com/r/sneakers/#wd)\n[](#specialbutton)[Collection](http://co.reddit.com/r/sneakers/#co)[](#rightalign)[](#specialbutton)[Pick Ups](http://pu.reddit.com/r/sneakers/#pu)\n[](#specialbutton)[Restock](http://re.reddit.com/r/sneakers/#re)[](#rightalign)[](#specialbutton)[Question](http://qu.reddit.com/r/sneakers/#qu)\n[](#specialbutton)[Discussion](http://di.reddit.com/r/sneakers/#di)[](#rightalign)[](#specialbutton)[ID](http://id.reddit.com/r/sneakers/#id)\n[](#specialbutton)[News](http://ne.reddit.com/r/sneakers/#ne)[](#rightalign)[](#specialbutton)[Release](http://nr.reddit.com/r/sneakers/#nr)\n[](#bigbutton)[View Contest Posts](http://ct.reddit.com/r/sneakers/#ct) \n[](#bigbutton)[View All Posts](http://reddit.com/r/sneakers) \n###+ Guides###\n* [Stores to buy from and avoid](http://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/wwx6z/guide_stores_to_buy_from_and_avoid/)\n* [Tips on copping a new release](http://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/x1ttw/guide_tips_on_copping_a_new_release/)\n* [Larry_bird_fan's Legit Check Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/15umiy/how_to_legit_check_your_own_shoes_a_very_large/)\n* [The Definitive Guide to Shoe Laces](http://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/1d8kwr/guide_the_definitive_guide_to_shoe_laces/)\n* [joeyferg3's New Release Guide (very thorough, full of links)]\n(http://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/1lj0ke/new_release_guide/)\n* [SNEAKER RELATED WEBSITE GUIDE](http://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/1l44ni/can_we_put_together_a_website_guide/)\n* [The Cockpuncher's guide to spotting fake websites](http://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/1floyw/about_legit_checking_websites/)\n* [Guide to legit check v1 Yeezy 350 boosts] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/62z6fq/guide_how_to_legit_check_yeezy_350s/) \n* [Stenzy's guide to buying and selling on Instagram and Facebook](http://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/1kblbf/guide_using_facebookinstagram_to_purchase_and/)\n* [Campless Sneaker Price Guide](http://www.campless.com/guide) \n* [Stenzy's Guide to Sneaker Cleaning and Maintenance](http://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/1rtmdf/guide_cleaning_caring_and_maintaining_your/?sort=confidence)\n* [Barock_Obama's Guide to Casual Sneakers On a Budget] \n(http://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/2e9b1o/we_should_create_a_guide_to_buying_casual/) \n* [PissedOnBible's tips for copping online] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/36zil3/someone_asked_me_to_post_this_in_the_sidebar_and/)\n* [How to minimize your chances of taking an L on Yeezys](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/5ienil/guide_how_to_minimize_your_chances_of_taking_an_l/)\n* [Lukeydukey's guide to common /r/sneakers acronyms/abbreviations](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/5z6201/new_releases_thread_313_319/df280rk/)\n* [Axxidentt's guide to copping kicks for retail](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/60x5mb/as_promised_here_is_my_copping_kicks_for_retail/)\n* [guijcm's guide to 80 online sneaker stores](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/6vgtvd/online_sneaker_shopping_store_guide_80_stores/)\n* [sheek360's guide on how to properly clean your shoes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/9uqnk0/how_to_properly_clean_your_shoes/)\n###+ Member Discounts###\n* Use code *Reddit15* for 15% off any order at [Lace Lab](http://www.Lacelab.com)\n* Use code *Reddit10* for 10% off any order at [Laced Up Laces](https://www.laceduplaces.com/).\n* Rufus Styles cares about your kicks.

Message the moderators, and we will free it for you (assuming it is not actually spam.)\n**Self Promotion** - The community has spoken: If you only submit links to your own content, your links will be removed as spam. We suggest being an active member of reddit before submitting links to your own site.\n**Pictures of your stuff** – These can be somewhat controversial. They will be actively removed, unless there is some kind of necessary discussion involved. \n**Memes** – These will be actively removed, but consider posting in /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu, /r/AdviceAnimals, or /r/memes.\n**Surveys** – No surveys unless you're an active community member of /r/cycling. Surveys from new accounts will be removed.\n**Don't be a jerk. Be kind to each other.** - Don't attack people. If you can't say it nicely then perhaps don't say it at all. It isn't your job to \"fix\" random people on the internet. If someone insults you then move on or report them: Do not respond in kind.\n**No Racism/Hate Speech** - There will be zero tolerance for racism, homophobia/transphobia, or sexism/misogyny, engaging in any sort of hate speech will result in the post or comment being removed and the poster being banned. We do not allow hate speech.\n**No Victim Blaming** - Unless there is compelling evidence that a victim directly caused the accident there will be no speculation as to how they might have done so. The onus is always on the least vulnerable to protect the most vulnerable. If in fact someone dies as a direct result of their action we will respect rule 5 and make it a *kind* teachable moment.\n---\nPlease keep discussions civil and respectful.

Every interaction on the subreddit must be kind, respectful, and welcoming. We also have several rules concerning spoilers, appropriate content, and more. \n[**Please be familiar with our rules, here, before interacting in our community.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/about/rules)\n#FAQ\n[Full FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/wiki/faq) \n[Spoiler Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/wiki/spoilers) \n[What's the Cosmere?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_the_cosmere.3F) \n[What does \"RAFO\" mean?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/wiki/faq#wiki_what_does_.22rafo.22_mean.3F) \n[What does \"WoB\" mean?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/wiki/faq#wiki_what_does_.22wob.22_mean.3F) \n[Reading order advice?

Do not include spoilers in post titles. This includes no direct quotes from the books, except where allowed at the moderators' discretion. \n#####Spoiler Markup\nUse spoiler markup to hide any spoilers outside the scope of a post's spoiler tag. The following markup is used:\n**[TWoK] \\\u0026gt;\\!Szeth\\!\\\u0026lt; is Truthless.**\nproduces [TWoK] \u0026gt;!Szeth!\u0026lt; is Truthless.\nNote that it is important *not* to include a space after the first \"!\".\nPlease also note that you *cannot* use the syntax for embedding a link behind a string of text inside a spoiler tag. Doing so will cause the text to display on the reddit android app. \n#Links\n#####Post Collections\n* [Subreddit Announcements](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/collection/c9503e1f-20b9-4fb9-bf07-c664bfffbc97)\n* [Rhythm of War Prerelease Chapter Releases](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/collection/824ff83b-fe92-4652-8e0b-443792cebf4c)\n* [Rhythm of War Updates](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/collection/ac56432d-d3cd-4ef6-b359-5b947a88c18c)\n#####Subreddit Wiki\n* [Wiki Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/wiki/index)\n* [Things You May Have Missed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/wiki/thingsyoumissed)\n* [Spoiler-Safe Art Gallery](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/wiki/gallery)\n* [Post Archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/wiki/archive)\n#####Interviews, Q\u0026amp;As, and News\n* State of the Sanderson: [2021](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/state-of-the-sanderson-2021/)\n#####Official Sites\n* [Brandon Sanderson's Site](http://www.brandonsanderson.com)\n* [Tor.com - The Stormlight Archive](http://www.tor.com/tag/the-stormlight-archive/)\n#####Fansites\n* [The 17th Shard - Official Fansite](http://www.17thshard.com/)\n* [17th Shard Discord](https://discord.gg/7rTvZnK)\n* [The Coppermind Wiki](http://coppermind.net/wiki/) (spoilers!)\n* [Arcanum - WoB Archive](http://wob.coppermind.net) (spoilers!)\n* [Stormlight Archive Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TheStormlightArchive)\n* [cosmere.es](https://roshar.cosmere.es/)\n* [Stormlight Archive on Cosmere Chat](https://discord.gg/Y83JZy4)\n* [SA Spliki](https://spliki.com/wiki/stormlight_archive) (WIP spoiler-free wiki)\n#####Related Subreddits\n* /r/BrandonSanderson\n* /r/Mistborn\n* /r/Cosmere\n* /r/cosmere_es \n* /r/StormlightArchiveBC\n* /r/imaginarycosmere\n* /r/cremposting\n* /r/brandosandopuns \n* /r/DarkOne \n* /r/reckoners \n* /r/fantasy \n#Spoiler Tag Filters\nFilter by spoiler flair level:\n##Mobile or with CSS disabled:\n##[No Spoilers](/r/Stormlight_Archive/search?sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;q=flair%3A(\"No Spoilers\"\\))\n##[TWoK](/r/Stormlight_Archive/search?sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;q=flair%3A(\"No Spoilers\"+OR+\"The Way of Kings\"\\))\n##[WoR](/r/Stormlight_Archive/search?sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;q=flair%3A(\"No Spoilers\"+OR+\"The Way of Kings\"+OR+\"Words of Radiance\"\\))\n##[Edgedancer](/r/Stormlight_Archive/search?sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;q=flair%3A(\"No Spoilers\"+OR+\"The Way of Kings\"+OR+\"Words of Radiance\"+OR+Edgedancer\\))\n##[Oathbringer](/r/Stormlight_Archive/search?sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;q=flair%3A(\"No Spoilers\"+OR+\"The Way of Kings\"+OR+\"Words of Radiance\"+OR+Edgedancer+OR+Oathbringer\\))\n##[Dawnshard](/r/Stormlight_Archive/search?sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;q=flair%3A(\"No Spoilers\"+OR+\"The Way of Kings\"+OR+\"Words of Radiance\"+OR+Edgedancer+OR+Oathbringer+OR+Dawnshard\\))\n##[RoW](/r/Stormlight_Archive/search?sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;q=flair%3A(\"No+Spoilers\"+OR+\"The Way of Kings\"+OR+\"Words of Radiance\"+OR+Edgedancer+OR+Oathbringer+OR+Dawnshard+OR+\"Rhythm of War\"\\)+-flair%3A(Warbreaker\\))\n##[Warbreaker+](/r/Stormlight_Archive/search?sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;q=-flair%3A(Cosmere+OR+\"Non-canon\"\\))\n##[Cosmere](/r/Stormlight_Archive/search?sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;q=-flair%3A\"Non-canon\"\\))\n##[Non-canon](/r/Stormlight_Archive)\n##Desktop:\n####[No Spoilers](https://b0.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/)\n####[TWoK](https://b1.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/)\n####[WoR](https://b2.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/)\n####[Edgedancer](https://c2.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/)\n####[Oathbringer](https://b3.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/)\n####[Dawnshard](https://c3.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/)\n####[RoW](https://b4.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/)\n####[Warbreaker+](https://wb.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/)\n####[Cosmere](https://co.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/)\n####[Non-canon](/r/Stormlight_Archive/)\n---\n*A special THANK YOU to [virgiliart](http://virgiliart.deviantart.com/) for the custom Kaladin Snoo and to [Ly Eldalagren](http://lyeldalagren.tumblr.com/) for the sidebar image!

If you have issues with r/WWE rules, message the moderators to address.\n* **SPOILER POLICY:** Spoiler times run for 24 hours after a TV show or PPV ends. Anything that takes place on a TV show or PPV is a spoiler. It does not matter if it is a “real life event”, if it occurs on a live show or PPV, or is mentioned on a live show or PPV, it meets our definition of “spoiler”. If you post a spoiler, TAG YOUR POST as a spoiler. Do not post spoilers in the title of your posts. Do not post a photo with a spoiler, as not all platforms will hide the photo. While a TV show or live event is in progress, we create a discussion thread for the live event or PPV that is in progress. \n* **WHY CAN'T I POST?** When a show is live (TV/PPV/ETC), we lock the sub (until the next morning) so posts aren't allowed. This avoids spoilers for those who don't watch live. If you can't post, look to see if a show or PPV is airing live, and that's why.\n* **NO TROLLING:** Trolling is an instant ban. This includes on the sub and in the chat room. This also includes \"WWE sucks, X promotion is better\" trolling. \n* **REPORT OFFENSIVE/SPAMMY/BAD CONTENT:** This subreddit will be a better environment for new/discussion if substandard content is reported. You can send a link to the content via modmail or use Reddit's reporting system to report a post. This sub does not allow racist, offensive or pornographic content, including memes.\n* **RESPECT OTHERS**: r/WWE does not tolerate bigotry, sexism, racism, homophobia, or transphobia against members, or wrestlers. This includes discussion of male/female violence. We also do not tolerate disrespect or attacks towards r/WWE staff and admins. Disrespecting users will result in a 7 day ban. Disrespecting or attacking moderators and admins will result in a permaban. Disrespecting r/WWE or r/WWE staff on others subs or your personal account/profile will result in a perma ban. Also, attacking people because they like more than just WWE will result in a ban. People are allowed to enjoy and consume any content they desire, and we will not stand for attacks on those who enjoy other promotions.\n* **\"SHITPOSTING\", KARMA FARMING \u0026amp; UNRELATED POSTS/MEMES/APPROPRIATE CONTENT/SEXUALIZING TALENT**: Do not post random stuff just for karma. This especially applies to dumb memes that have nothing to do with anything. Admins and moderators reserve the right to remove memes that seem to be pointless. Shitposting will result in a ban. If it doesn't feel like it belongs here, it goes to r/WWEMemes. Also, this isn't a game sub. Video game stuff goes to r/WWEGames. Also, this sub doesn't exist to sexualize women, nor to comment on the appearance of WWE female performers (\"hot\", \"sexy\", etc). It's not a sub for \"thirst traps\", or to post horny pics. There are multiple other subs to obsess over women's bodies, or \"who was the hottest\" / \"who's the hottest\", we don't do that here. \n* **NO STREAMING SITES:** Do not ask for, post or share links to sites streaming PPVs and shows. Links will be deleted as spam and those sharing/asking for illegal stream links will be banned.\n* **SELF PROMOTION POLICY:** This subreddit does not allow self promotion. Do not use r/wwe to promote your social media, blog, website, Twitch, Discord, YouTube channel, or podcast. Violators will be banned. \n* **NO POLITICS:** This is a forum for discussion of r/wwe. Regardless of whether or not a US President has been related to WWE in some form, we do not allow political discussion here. There are plenty of subs out there for that. The only exception is when politics has a **direct effect** on WWE, such as Florida declaring WWE an essential business during the COVID-19 outbreak of 2020.\n* **MAJOR TOPICS/MEGATHREADS:** When a major event occurs, megathreads will be created to group discussion so they don't overtake the sub. All related discussion (predictions, etc) should be kept in this threads and individual created threads will be locked/removed. If a thread is locked/deleted and the user posts it again, this may lead to a ban. Those who disrespect, attack, or insult mods, staff, or the r/WWE sub for organizing minor threads into a megathread will receive a 7 day ban.\n* **LEAKED RESULTS:** Do not post leaked results of taped shows.\n* **SELLING:** Don't use r/WWE to sell your stuff or link to your auctions. This is a discussion forum, not a platform for you to sell your stuff.\n* **REPOSTING REMOVED POSTS:** If your post is removed, don't repost it, or post \"why was my post removed\". Review the sub's rules, or PM admin/mod staff at r/WWE to inquire.\n* **AEW Discussion:** Per the results of [a vote by members of this sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/paxacg/regarding_aew_discussion_on_rwwe/), limited AEW discussion is allowed only if it is **extremely relevant** to WWE.

This should include trim, major options (engine, 2WD/4WD, specific options or add-ons), and an honest evaluation of the condition. Mods reserve the right to remove excessively vague posts that are not clarified within a reasonable time frame.\n#####Rule Two\nPlease let us know if you are financing or paying cash in regards to a lot purchase, so we can respond with the appropriate information for your situation. As well as what country/state you live in. \n#####Rule Three\nIf you have suggestions/thoughts/comments or anything you need to discuss with us then please press the message the mods button below, we will reply as promptly as possible.\n#####Rule Four\nIf Posting any type of links, Please format them. Only flaired car salespeople are allowed to submit links such as videos or blog posts. All other links are only allowed in the body of a question. Do not post a link to your dealership's site, or any site for the purpose of selling your wares. This is considered spam.\n#####Rule Five\nIf you are a car salesperson - we encourage you to submit proof to mods to get flair, so that anyone will see if an answer comes from a salesperson, or a regular Redditor. To submit this request, message the moderators.\n#####Rule Six\nThe Mod Team has final say in all disputes. \n#####Rule Seven\nSpamming will not be tolerated. This includes trying to make a sale through the comments. We don't allow commercial advertisements, messages, solicitation or referrals in here. Basically if you're looking to transact business it's not permitted here.\n#####Rule Eight\n**WE WILL NOT DO VIN CHECKS! This Includes CarFax and Autocheck, and MMRs.**\nWe will, however, provide VIN checks for new car rebate compatibility, especially as it pertains to manufacturer pricing plans such as Ford A/D/X/Z-Plan, or FCA Affiliates Rewards Program.\n#####Rule Nine\n**24 Hour Engagement Requirement.** If you post a question in this sub and then do NOT engage in the discussion within 24 hours, the thread gets deleted. These context-less threads are a breeding ground for troll activity and they contribute nothing to the overall ability of this sub to impart knowledge on subscribers. We want robust discussions here where people can get the whole picture of a situation. These threads only provide a sliver of context and result in a LOT of assumptions and guesses.\n#####Rule Ten\nI thought this went without saying but apparently it needs to be said - this is our sub. It was created and is run by people in the car industry. You're allowed to dislike us but if you express that in here you'll be warned. If the behaviour continues you'll be banned. At mods discretion we may skip the warning if we feel you'll never be a valuable participant here. There are hundreds of subreddits you can subscribe to where bashing our profession is welcomed. This is not one of them.\n#####Rule Eleven\nThis sub exists for industry professionals, past and retired alike to give consumers advice navigating the car buying process. Non-flaired users, people not in the car industry are welcome to provide additional feedback but keep in mind it is a courtesy. Only verified/flaired industry people are allowed to make top level responses. If your advice is found to be harmful, misleading, incomplete or derisive of our industry (see rule 10) that privilege will be revoked. Some examples of advice that will not be tolerated here include \"Never buy a (new) car until you own a house and max out your retirement savings.\", \"Never buy a car you can't pay for with cash.\", \"Never buy any aftermarket / add-on products or warranties.\", \"Leases are bad/Never Lease.\" or really any other \"Frugal\" response or absolute.\n#Terms - A guide to help you!\n* APR - Annual Percentage Rate\n* OTD - Out the Door (Pricing)\n* TTT - Tag's, Title, Taxes\n* NE/PE - Negative Equity or Positive Equity\n* TIV - Trade in Value\n* ACV - Actual Cash Value\n* MSRP - Manufacturer's Standard Retail Pricing\n* DX - Dealer Exchange\n* CPO - Certified Pre-Owned\n#Related Subreddits\n* /r/Acura\n* /r/Audi\n* /r/Autos\n* /r/beetle\n* /r/BMW\n* /r/Cadillac\n* /r/Carbuying\n* /r/Cars\n* /r/Chevy\n* /r/Coolcarsforsale\n* /r/Dodge\n* /r/Electricvehicles\n* /r/fahrvergnugen\n* /r/Fiat\n* /r/Ford\n* /r/Honda\n* /r/IBoughtACarOneTime\n* /r/Infiniti\n* /r/Jeep\n* /r/jetta\n* /r/Kia\n* /r/Landrover\n* /r/Lexus\n* /r/Mazda\n* /r/Mercedes_Benz\n* /r/Mini\n* /r/Mitsubishi\n* /r/Nissan\n* /r/Pontiac\n* /r/Saab\n* /r/Scion\n* /r/Subaru\n* /r/Suzuki\n* /r/tdi\n* /r/Toyota\n* /r/Trucks\n* /r/Volkswagen\n* /r/Volvo\n* /r/vwswaps\n* /r/whatcarshouldibuy"},{"display_name":"AppleWatch","description":"###[Hide **My Watch** Posts](http://hp.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch )\n###[Show **My Watch** Posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch)\n###[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/wiki/guides/faq)\n##### Rules\n1. **No Low Quality/Standard Configuration My Watch posts.** Please ensure your My Watch post is clear and well-lit (unless it's a choice), is not a standard configuration (combos you can buy from Apple), and, if possible, provide more than one angle/shot.

All are welcome to participate who agree to follow the rules outlined below:\n-------------\n# Rules\n---\n\u0026gt;###1: Be respectful \nNo GSRM-Phobic content (i.e: homophobia, bi/panphobia, transphobia, aphobia, as well as racism, serophobia, ableism, or sexism) If you are submitting a post that contains hateful remarks or triggering language, please precede your post's title with [TW]. For example: \"[TW] Title of Post\". Do not try to start an argument for the sake of an argument. Do not make personal attacks.\n---\n\u0026gt;###2: Must have willingness to learn; no 'you're too sensitive' \nDemonstrate a willingness to learn. This is a safe space. Anyone can make a mistake and accidentally say something hurtful or triggering. If you find yourself corrected for making this error, please try to learn from it. This is not a place to tell people that they need to reclaim a pejorative so you can use it, that they should laugh at jokes about them, or that they otherwise just \"shouldn't be so sensitive.\" For lightly moderated LGBT-related discussion, we recommend /r/ainbow. \n---\n\u0026gt;###3: No bait-and-switch posts \nBait and switch type threads, where the title makes them look like a bigot but the body is supportive, are not allowed on r/lgbt. LGBTQ+ people see enough hate in our lives, without 'Gotcha' bait posts.\n---\n\u0026gt;###4: No advertisements, spam, or crowdfunders \nr/lgbt is here for LGBTQ+ people, their lives, their stories, their content. It is not here for advertising or spam. This includes the advertising of crowdfunders, we cannot verify them, so for safety, we do not allow them.\n---\n\u0026gt;###5: No survey and research requests \nWe are unable to accommodate Survey and Research requests, posts that fall into this category shall be removed. Repeat posters will be banned. We suggest you post these requests to /r/lgbtstudies.\n---\n\u0026gt;###6: No promoting hate \nHaving posted to subreddits with a negative reputation is not necessarily grounds for an automatic ban, but users whose posting history contains bigotry will be met with intense scrutiny.\n---\n\u0026gt;###7: Don't share hate speech \nr/lgbt is a safe space, and while we want everyone to be able to seek support and advice, sharing hate speech in any way can cause harm to the community.\n---\n\u0026gt;###8: Don't direct message individual mods about a moderation issue--use modmail! \nPlease send [a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flgbt) to r/lgbt rather than DMing individual moderators. This will allow the whole team to know what is going on so the correct moderator can deal with the issue.\n---\n\u0026gt;###9: NSFW Content. \nr/lgbt is meant to be safe for users of all ages. Do not submit content that a reasonable viewer may not want to be seen accessing in public or at the workplace. This includes pornography, sexualized content, graphic violence, or similar. Discussions of sexual topics, including sexual health, are permitted but must be tagged NSFW.\n---\n\u0026gt;###10: Provide sources when sharing news\nWe require any post sharing news/social media reactions to news articles to include a link to the original article or announcement in the post body.\n---\n\u0026gt;###11: No posts asking to rate, roast, or make assumptions about you or your identity.\nThese posts encourage stereotyping or making assumptions about people based on presentation. Often these can make people uncomfortable and bring out a mix of stereotypes and pressure to present a specific way. This rule includes, but is not limiting to; asking whether or not you pass, asking people to guess your gender/sexuality, and asking people to make assumptions about you based on your appearance.\n---\n\u0026gt;###12: Moderator Discretion.\nUnfortunately, there will always be some things that our rules do not currently or perfectly cover, in those cases we reserve the right to take action and remove anything that we think could potentially cause harm or does not fit within the spirit of the community and the safe space we maintain here, even if it do not fit one of the rules perfectly.\n\u0026gt;###13: Use Content Warning flair for upsetting posts.\nIf you think community members might be upset by the content you are sharing, use the content warning flair, adding a short description. The post will be automatically marked as a spoiler, but please check our rules on NSFW content and sharing hate.\n-------------\n#[Important Information on Staying Safe](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/kytz4c/a_reminder_on_staying_safe_online_for_all_our/)\n---\n#[Report Rule Breaking Content](https://www.reddit.com/report)\n---\n#[Interested in becoming a Mod?

Using the upvote/downvote system as a form of voting is not allowed. [^(note)](https://old.reddit.com/r/polls/wiki/rules/rule-1/note-1)\n2. **Be respectful.** Hate speech (racism, homophobia, sexism, transphobia, ableism, etc.) will not be tolerated and will result in a permanent ban. This includes polls with disrespectful or hateful options. Additionally, do not personally attack other users or make inflammatory comments against others.\n3. **Posts must have a clear and direct question of the poll in the title and specify the demographic they're for.** You are welcome to elaborate on the question in the post body. If your poll is for all demographics, make sure that you provide enough context for anyone to answer.\n4. **Flair your post correctly.** Make sure that the flair you've chosen fits the subject of your poll. The \"Other\" flair should **only** be used if no other flair matches the topic of your poll.\n5. **Do not metabait.** An example of metabaiting would be asking people to upvote a poll.\n6. **Do not post NSFW content.** We do not allow for NSFW content, poll or otherwise. Exceptionally creepy content may fall under this rule as well at moderator discretion.\n7. **Do not push specific agendas or post loaded questions.** Do not manipulate users into following an agenda through polls. This includes [loaded questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_question) and insinuating that one option is the “correct” one.\n8. **Do not post polls that were already posted in the last week, are on [our Frequently Reposted Polls list](https://old.reddit.com/r/polls/wiki/index) or are in the [top 25 polls of last month](/r/polls/top/?t=month).** If the poll you're trying to make fails to meet the above requirements, it will be removed.\n9. **Limit yourself to 5 posts per 24 hours.** If you make more than that, every post after the threshold will be automatically removed until you're eligible to post again.

Our goal is to provide a platform for professionals in various fields such as finance, education, programming, healthcare, and legal to share their knowledge and experience with using ChatGPT in their respective fields.\nOur community is focused on the latest techniques and best practices for using ChatGPT in professional settings. Join us to stay up-to-date on the latest developments in the field and connect with other like-minded professionals.\nHere are a few things to keep in mind while participating in this subreddit:\n1. Be respectful and considerate of others' opinions and perspectives.\n1. Please keep discussions focused on the professional usage of ChatGPT and avoid discussions on storytelling, games, or toy usage. If you post about fiction writing, you need to focus on a particular part of your workflow. We don't want to hear your story or conversation where ChatGPT responded like a gangster. [Example of a good post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/10s2io6/crosspost_there_is_a_way_for_chatgpt_to_analyze/).\n1. Questions should be specific about the task you are trying to enhance and provide plenty of detail about what you are trying to do.\n1. Not everything commercial is spam. It's okay to discuss using ChatGPT in advertising here. That's a professional usage. However, remember we don't want to see your copy. We want to see your workflow and how you use it professionally.\n1. You may post about AI tools other than ChatGPT, free or paid. However, the app must offer something new or unique that ChatGPT cannot do. If ChatGPT can replicate the functionality of your app, don't post it.\nThank you for being a part of the ChatGPTPro community, and we look forward to your contributions!"},{"display_name":"DiWHY","description":"Ever try fixing things on your own?

([instructions here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/1uq68v/how_to_flair_your_post/))\n2. **Do not self-promote** Do not link your own content, including your blog, youtube, survey, website, instagram, or store. Posting this content will result in a ban. Instagram handles are OK, but not links, and only in comments, not titles. (May only be shared once per thread, use a 1:10 content ratio.) Surveys should also be cleared with the moderators before being shared on the sub. If the youtube video you are posting is your own content or on your own channel, you may not post it here.\n3. **Keep posts and comments related to curly hair** We are here to embrace, nourish, and love our wavy, curly, coily, kinky hair. Keep posts and comments related to curly hair. Off topic comments and posts related to straightening hair may be removed.\n4. **Practice good [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).** \nKeep it PG. Nearly all posts \u0026amp; photos in this subreddit are original content, meaning there is a real person behind each post who deserves to be treated with respect. Use the report button if you see anything inappropriate and feel free to message the mods. It's anonymous!\n5. **No sexual/creepy/harassing comments** Keep it PG. Nearly all posts \u0026amp; photos in this subreddit are original content, meaning there is a real person behind each post who deserves to be treated with respect.\n6. **Include everybody.** Anyone with any amount of texture in their hair is welcome here. Passing judgment on whether someone else’s hair is “curly enough” is neither useful nor productive for our common goal of bringing out the best in our hair. Please also remember that terms like “afro” and “big chop” have a long and complex history within the natural hair movement for black women (see wiki). To keep our community welcoming, it’s important that we respect these words and use them appropriately.\n7. **Do not privately message users of this subreddit.** Reminder: this is a SFW subreddit. Do not privately message users, especially with \"compliments\" (those can be shared publicly) or sexual requests. If you wish to contact someone via PM, ask them in public chat first. They do not need to answer you.\n8. **Respect cultural terms** The natural hair movement has a long history and the words created in it have meanings. It’s important to respect where these words, techniques, and more came from, and celebrate the importance of the work done by these early pioneers. Please be aware of terms such as “big chop”, “afro”, “natural hair journey”. Be thoughtful and respectful about using these powerful terms appropriately!\n#Filter Posts\n\u0026gt;[help](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/search?q=flair%3Ahelp\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all) \n\u0026gt;[vent](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/search?q=flair%3Avent\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all) \n\u0026gt;[product review](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/search?q=flair%3Aproduct_review\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all) \n\u0026gt;[discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/search?q=flair%3Adiscussion\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all) \n\u0026gt;[hair victory](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/search?q=flair%3Ahair_victory\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all) \n\u0026gt;[update](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/search?q=flair%3Aupdate\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n\u0026gt;[resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/search?q=flair%3Aresource\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n\u0026gt;[sale](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/search?q=flair%3Asale\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n\u0026gt;[fluff](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/search?q=flair%3Afluff\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n\u0026gt;[curl type](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/search?q=flair%3Acurl_type\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n# Filter Out Posts\n\u0026gt;[help](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/search?q=NOT+flair%3Ahelp\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all) \n\u0026gt;[hair victory](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/search?q=NOT+flair%3Ahair_victory\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all) \n\u0026gt;[fluff](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/search?q=NOT+flair%3Afluff\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all)\n#Useful Links\n**Curly Basics**\n\u0026gt;[**--\u0026gt;Wiki!

We monitor things a bit loose here, but will step in without regard if the content does not fit our sub theme or violates site guidelines. **No polls, surveys, research for school, no ads, DO NOT LIST PRICES, as they are not relevant to the rest of the world, limited self promotion, do not ask for dietary advice or medical advice, etc.** Please be positive, constructive criticism is welcome but being mean is not.

We hope you will find this as a valuable resource in your journeys down the fruitful CS/IT career paths. This community leans towards being a specialized subreddit facilitating discussion amongst individuals who have gained some ground in the IT world. \nFor an idea of what is encouraged in this subreddit and what is not (please report anything that does not follow the rules):\n# [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/about/rules/)\n**1. Do not participate unless experienced (3+ years)**\nIf you have less than 3 years of experience as a developer, do not make a post, nor participate in comments threads except for the weekly “Ask Experienced Devs” auto-thread. No exceptions.\n**2. No Disrespectful Language or Conduct**\nDon’t be a jerk. Act maturely. No racism, unnecessarily foul language, ad hominem charges, sexism - none of these are tolerated here. This includes posts that could be interpreted as trolling, such as complaining about DEI (Diversity) initiatives or people of a specific sex or background at your company.\nDo not submit posts or comments that break, or promote breaking the Reddit Terms and Conditions or Content Policy or any other Reddit policy.\nViolations = Warning, 7-Day Ban, Permanent Ban.\n**3. No General Career Advice**\nThis sub is for discussing issues specific to experienced developers. \nAny career advice thread must contain questions and/or discussions that notably benefit from the participation of experienced developers. Career advice threads may be removed at the moderators discretion based on response to the thread.\"\nGeneral rule of thumb: If the advice you are giving (or seeking) could apply to a “Senior Chemical Engineer”, it’s not appropriate for this sub.\n**4. No \"Which Offer Should I Take\" Posts**\nAsking if you should ask for a raise, switch companies (“should I work for company A or company B”), “should I take offer A or offer B”, or related questions, is not appropriate for this sub. \nThis includes almost any discussion about a “hot market”, comparing compensation between companies, etc.\n**5. No “What Should I Learn” Questions**\nNo questions like “Should I learn C#” or “Should I switch jobs into a language I don’t know?”\nDiscussion about industry direction or upcoming technologies is fine, just frame your question as part of a larger discussion (“What have you had more success with, RDBMS or NoSQL?”) and you’ll be fine.\ntl;dr: Don’t make it about you/yourself.\n**6. No “I hate X types of interviews\" Posts**\nThis has been re-hashed over and over again. There is no interesting/new content coming out.\nIt might be OK to talk about the merits of an interview process, or compare what has been successful at your company, but if it ends up just turning into complaints your post might still be removed.\n#Related Subs\n[CS Career Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions)\n[CS Career Questions: Europe](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU)\n[CS Interview Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/CS_Questions)\n[Learn Programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming)\n[General Programming Discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming)\n[Coding](http://www.reddit.com/r/coding)\n[CS Theory](http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci)\n[CS Education](http://www.reddit.com/r/CSEducation)\n[IT Career Questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions)\n[Telecommuting](http://www.reddit.com/r/telecommuting)\n[General Job Discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs)\n[Digital Nomads](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad)\n[Ask Network Security](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec)\n[NetSec Students](https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents)\n[Career Guidance](https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/)\n---"},{"display_name":"thenetherlands","description":"Welkom bij de grootste tweetalige Reddit community voor het delen van alles gerelateerd aan Nederland: nieuws, sport, humor, cultuur en vragen. \nWelcome to the largest bilingual Reddit community for sharing anything related to the Netherlands: news, sports, humor, culture and questions.\n### **Our Policy**\n* **[Please read the full version before posting here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/theNetherlands/wiki/rules)**\n* Adhere to the [Reddit content policy](http://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) and the [reddiquette](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette) (also [available in Dutch](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/nl/reddiquette)).\n* No surveys, petitions or spam.\n* No low-effort posts or low-effort questions.\n* Posts must be related to the Netherlands.\n* Titles and text posts must be descriptive and objective.\n* Do not post duplicates of previously posted material.\n* Assign your post the proper [link flair](/r/theNetherlands/wiki/linkflair); no [tags].\n* Adhere to the subreddit's language guidelines.\n### **Useful Links**\n* [Upcoming events \u0026amp; scheduled posts](/r/thenetherlands/wiki/upcoming)\n* [Our Wiki \u0026amp; FAQ](/r/theNetherlands/wiki/index)\n* [The Netherlands on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands)\n* [Immigration and Naturalisation Service](https://ind.nl/EN)\n* [TripAdvisor: top things to do in the Netherlands](https://www.tripadvisor.nl/Attractions-g188553-Activities-The_Netherlands.html)\n* [Public transport planner](http://9292.nl/en#)\n* [Juridisch Loket: legal advice](https://www.juridischloket.nl/over-het-juridisch-loket/contact)\n* [Sociaal Verhaal: legal advice](http://www.sociaalverhaal.com/)\n* [Rechtswinkel: legal advice](http://www.rechtswinkel.nl/)\n* [VerlorenOfGevonden.nl: lost and found](https://www.verlorenofgevonden.nl/)\n* [DuoLingo Dutch course](http://www.duolingo.com/course/nl-NL/en/Leer-Nederlands-online)\n* [Memrise various Dutch courses](http://www.memrise.com/courses/english/dutch/)\n* [Dutch Grammar](http://www.dutchgrammar.com/en/)\n### **Related Communities**\n* r/Amsterdam\n* r/Rotterdam\n* r/TheHague\n* r/Utrecht\n* r/Eindhoven\n* r/ik_ihe \n* r/LearnDutch\n* **[View all related communities](http://www.reddit.com/r/theNetherlands/wiki/related)**\n###### [Discord Server: https://discord.gg/theNetherlands](https://discord.gg/theNetherlands#discord)\n###### [IRC Channel: #theNetherlands on Snoonet](https://webchat.snoonet.org/#thenetherlands) \n[Hide **hot** posts](http://xc.reddit.com/r/theNetherlands/#xc)\n[Only **hot** posts](http://sc.reddit.com/r/theNetherlands/#sc) \n[Hide **news** posts](http://xn.reddit.com/r/theNetherlands/#xn)\n[Only **news** posts](http://sn.reddit.com/r/theNetherlands/#sn) \n[Hide **sports** posts](http://xs.reddit.com/r/theNetherlands/#xs)\n[Only **sports** posts](http://ss.reddit.com/r/theNetherlands/#ss) \n[Hide **humorous** posts](http://xj.reddit.com/r/theNetherlands/#xj)\n[Only **humorous** posts](http://sj.reddit.com/r/theNetherlands/#sj) \n[Hide **cultural** posts](http://xz.reddit.com/r/theNetherlands/#xz)\n[Only **cultural** posts](http://sz.reddit.com/r/theNetherlands/#sz) \n[Hide **questions**](http://xq.reddit.com/r/theNetherlands/#xq)\n[Only **questions**](http://sq.reddit.com/r/theNetherlands/#sq) \n[Hide **other** posts](http://xo.reddit.com/r/theNetherlands/#xo)\n[Only **other** posts](http://so.reddit.com/r/theNetherlands/#so) \n[**Show all posts**](http://www.reddit.com/r/theNetherlands/#sa)"},{"display_name":"Cartalk","description":"r/Cartalk is the original Reddit auto repair community, with over 650,000 subscribers and growing. We look forward to helping everyone with their car repairs and questions, but please take the time to read this sidebar.\n***\n**Post disappeared?** Read the following guidelines, and if you think it still is relevant, message the mods to free it from the spam filter.\n***\n####Content Guidelines\n**Be polite.** Treat those asking for help with respect, and answer without bias toward them, their situation, or their knowledge (or lack thereof) about the repair issues. Also respect those that take the time to answer questions and remember that many are professional mechanics, who normally get paid very well to diagnose automotive repairs.\n**We're here to help you**, but not to assist in negotiating with mechanics (this is business/life advice, not repair advice) or to tell you what car you should buy.\n**CAR REPAIR RELATED MEMES ARE OK **\n**Get OBD codes**! If you have a Check Engine (CEL) or Service Engine (SEL) Soon light on, get the codes read and have them available if possible befoer posting. You can have codes read at Auto Zone, Pep Boys, O'Reilly's, etc., for free in most states. Write them down. They will have a letter followed by four numbers, for example \"P1234\". You can get a code reader from Amazon that works with 1996 and up vehicles for about $15. It will let you read and reset the codes.\n**Some examples of things that are NOT GENERALLY ALLOWED:** links to articles or videos that are for profit, professional-level body work repairs, detailing or cleaning questions, aftermarket car stereo questions (/r/CarAV), car reviews (r/Cars), new \u0026amp; used vehicle recommendations, price comparisons for tires, stereos, exhaust, etc, and especially **questions regarding cost of repairs or the legitimacy of a mechanic's quote.** *\n **Remember that posting here is not a substitute for using Google. Most repairs have already been covered multiple times somewhere in great depth that will satisfy your needs. YouTube has many helpful topics. **\nIf you still aren't sure about something you are about to post, please look at the links down below for other subreddits that might be better suited for your question, or message the moderators.*\n**Have as much information as you can about the issue before posting**. Attempt to investigate the repair issue on your own. Take pictures, crawl under the car, look under the hood. By making a good attempt to narrow down where and what may be causing the problem you save those trying to help many steps in diagnosing the problem.** Be sure to also include the year, make, model and engine size of you car in your title, along with your main issue.** For example \"2003 Ford Crown Victoria 4.6L exhaust manifold bolts rusted off\" would be an acceptable post title. If you do not take the time to include this basic information your post may be removed until it is revised.\n**Report posts and comments that fall outside the guidelines.** By actively helping the moderators with this you ensure that the r/Cartalk community continues to be a worthwhile and knowledgeable resource for car repairs.\n.Also check out our friends at:\n* /r/autos\n* /r/classiccars\n* /r/drifting\n* /r/Topgear\n* /r/trucks\n* /r/dodge\n* /r/mercedes_benz\n* /r/Saab\n* /r/Subaru\n* /r/Nissan\n* /r/Datsun\n* /r/performancedriving\n* /r/AutoDetailing\n* /r/partscounter\n* /r/whatcarshouldIbuy\n* /r/electricvehicles"},{"display_name":"daddit","description":"\u0026gt; ##### FILTERS \n* [No Pictures](http://sa.reddit.com/r/daddit/#sa)\n* [Just Pictures](http://op.reddit.com/r/daddit/#op) \n* [Announcements](http://ma.reddit.com/r/daddit/#ma) \n* [Humor](http://hm.reddit.com/r/daddit/#hm) \n* [Stories](http://st.reddit.com/r/daddit/#st)\n* [Advice Requests](http://ad.reddit.com/r/daddit/#ad)\n* [Achievements](http://ac.reddit.com/r/daddit/#ac) \n* [Tips And Tricks](http://tt.reddit.com/r/daddit/#tt)\n* [Show All Posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/daddit) \n\u0026gt;#\n\u0026gt; ##### COMMUNITY\n- [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/wiki/rules)\n- [Dad Blogs](https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/wiki/blogs)\n- [Sidebar Art](https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/wiki/sidebarimages)\n- [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/wiki/faq)\n- [Tips and Tricks](https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/wiki/tips)\n- [DadGear](https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/wiki/dadgear)\n- [Health Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/wiki/create/health)\n- [Children Protective Services](https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/wiki/protect)\n- [User Flair List](https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/wiki/userflair)\n- [Daddit In The NYT!](https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/34omvq/daddit_in)\n****\n##Community Information##\nThis is a subreddit for Dads.

Sequencing music is no easy task... so we're here to help. [Be sure to ask smart questions](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#before).\nFeel free to volunteer great resources you find on the net regarding writing music, the Ableton DAW, or tutorials and the like.\n---------\n#Rules :\n1. Do not tell people to RTFM (read the fucking manual) unless you're also posting a link the specific section that covers their inquiry. Everyone should [bookmark the Live manual](https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/welcome-to-live/), for it loves you.\n2. Try to post about Ableton stuff. Try not to post about non-Ableton stuff. Memes and shitposts have been deemed by the community as non-Ableton stuff. We don't want to see your floor mat that looks like the Ableton logo.\n2. Participate in good faith and avoid being mean, condescending, or outright insulting other users.\n3. No piracy. Advocating, asking for, or giving advice on how to pirate is prohibited. Linking to piracy-centric subs also prohibited. Unless you can prove someone is using pirated software, don't accuse someone of using it. Don't ask, don't tell.\n1. Blatant self promotion and/or requests for feedback on your tracks are not permitted submissions. Feedback requests are encouraged in the relevant weekly threads. In regards to self promo, do not be a brand with a reddit account, be a redditor with a brand. If your post history is mostly your content posted multiple places and mostly your comments on your own videos, we probably aren't interested.\n4. Answer questions about your content if you post your own content. If you are not willing to field questions then your post will be removed at mod's discretion. \n5. If you are posting a link, [it must be a self post, you must do a writeup on the hardware and software, and you must answer questions about it in the commments. Failure to comply can result in your post being removed](https://redd.it/as3hbj). TL;DR - [No battlestations](https://redd.it/80ot9v), take them to /r/musicbattlestations.\n4. [Buy/Sell/Trade/Beg for Ableton stuff here, including software and hardware, in this thread and this thread only](https://redd.it/minb9j). Lite is not free, do not ask for it.\n9. Be clear in your titles. It should be clear what your post is about from the title itself. All post asking a question must end with a question mark. No all caps titles.\n10. No infographics unless you're going to post the entire text of the infographics inside the post as well. \nInfractions subject to a ban.\n---------\n##Ableton Help:\n/r/Ableton's [Official Resource Thread](https://redd.it/zkhqhe) - Updated for 2022, and not just for people learning.

Duplicate solo shuffle or MMR complaints and excessive whining**\nYes, we know that MMR in shuffle is not intuitive, queues are long for DPS, sometimes people are toxic, there’s a bug where it will sometimes say 49 days in queue, people don’t like healing shuffle and losing an arena game is frustrating.\nFor the health of the sub, we are deleting duplicate complaint posts. The WoW forums are a better place for those.\nNote this includes screenshots of arena scoreboards showing MMR/CR changes and “I’m quitting WoW” posts.\n**4. What should I play?**\nCheck our seasonal megathread to see what people are saying about each specialisation. \nPlease check murlok.io or moonkinmetrics.com if you’re wondering about which talents or gear you should use. \nYou can also use the World of PvP Discord for questions about what you should play: https://discord.gg/wowpvp\nSeason 2 Dragonflight spec discussion thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/worldofpvp/comments/13wwigh/what_are_you_playing_and_why_all_arena_spec/\n**5. Looking for group**\nUnfortunately, Reddit isn't a great place to look for groups so we do not allow individual posts to LFG/LFM. \nFortunately, other tools exist. There is an LFG feature on check-pvp which will allow you to look for players, message other players and display on your character profiles that you're looking for groups. You can find the check-pvp LFG tool here https://check-pvp.fr/lfg. \nThere is also an active LFG channel in the worldofpvp discord where you can look for players to queue with https://discord.gg/h2CasUp\n**6. Post quality**\nPost titles should be descriptive and not generic. Think \"struggling to consistent damage as rogue\" versus \"need help in arena\".\nSame with description. There are many people here willing to help in great detail, but you have to be specific about what you need feedback on or are struggling with. The gold standard is posting videos of your sessions to review.\nLow quality/low effort memes and posts will be removed.\n**7. Contributed Content and self promotion**\nContent creators are limited to 1 post per week about their content. This applies to any post that contains branding, video content, links to content off of reddit, or info about where to find content. If multiple people are involved in the content/creation, 1 post may be made per channel/team. Creators may comment in threads about their content without restriction as long as the content is relevant to the discussion.\nContent Contributors may create text posts (ie not a link to an external website) more than once per week with prior agreement from the mods if their content is substantially educational or useful to the community. When agreed with the mods beforehand, at the end of the post the Contributor may share details of work they do outside of the sub but related to WoW arena.\n**8. Duplicates**\nPlease utilise search in the sub before posting. If there have been one or several similar posts recently, your post will be deleted.\n**9. Oneshots**\nAll oneshot posts must be a recording of the oneshot happening without UI elements hidden. Screenshots of Details, combat logs or the oneshot happening will be removed.\nThe idea here is so there's context to these deaths that can lead to more meaningful discussion about what happened.\n**10. Tanks in Arena**\nDon’t post about tanks in arena. You have been warned.\n**11. Don't share anything that breaks WoW Terms of Service**\nDon't post or comment anything that breaks WoW TOS (including boosting, hacks, RMT etc).\n---\n###Related Subreddits\n* r/WoW\n* r/CompetitiveWoW \n* [Classic WoW PvP](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicWoW_PvP/)\n* r/Transmogrification \n* [UI Help](http://www.reddit.com/r/WowUI) \n* [Guilds and Recruiting](http://www.reddit.com/r/wowguilds) \n* [Recruit a Friend](http://www.reddit.com/r/wowraf)"},{"display_name":"AMA","description":"# ***Welcome to /r/AMA!***\n**Please read this sidebar before posting.**\nIf you can't act like a decent human being you will be banned.

Report something if you don't feel it is related to this sub, if enough reports are made, the mods will make a decision.\n2. **No Joke Comments**\nContributors take time to post on this sub, some of which are from the motorsport industry. So please respect them and don't make Joke comments in the top 2 levels of the comments. We are a technical sub, there are plenty of other F1 subs to make jokes. Failure to adhere to this will result in a 3 day ban for the first offence. A permanent ban for repeat offenders.\n3. **Repost/Duplicate Content**\nPlease remember to check the \"NEW\" page before posting.\nThis includes direct reposts and content that has been shared from a different source.\nWhen reporting a Repost/Duplicate post, please include a link to the original post in the description\n4. **Low Quality**\nLow Quality posts/comments will be removed. It is at the mods' discretion to determine whether a post is low quality. Users who break this rule will be subject to temporary bans. \n5. **Harrassment/Trollling**\nFollow Reddiquette, don't harass other users and don't troll.\nDon't provoke trolls by responding to their posts, simply downvote and report and the mods will take care of it.\nDo not wish harm upon drivers, team personnel or other users.\n6. **Bigotry/Whataboutism**\nRacist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic and xenophobic language is completely unacceptable and will result in disciplinary action.\nWe want everyone to feel welcome at r/F1Technical, regardless of their age, gender, sexual preferences, race etc.; no one should feel discriminated here.\nWhataboutism (e.g. Why hasn't X driver said anything about Y issue?) or other phrases implying this are also a violation of the rules.\n7. **Self Promotion**\nExcessive self promotion is not allowed. We follow the site-wide guideline on self promotion. \nNew users who intend to use this community to sell or promote their own social media or discord will not be allowed and will receive an instant permanent ban. \nUsers who have been members for over 6 months and are ACTIVE and trusted community members can post links to merchandise, books or their own site/social media/blog that they think other members may like.

Make a Submissions Statement!** \n \n* Original Content (your or a friend's work) must be accompanied by no less than a 300 character description of the project submitted as a comment to your own post. This includes, but is not limited to: what camera/film the project was shot on, techniques used, lights used, difficulties and limitations experienced during production, ...etc. \n* If you are a student or amateur, *you must seek feedback on your work*. Talk about what you did right, what you did wrong, and where you need help.\n* **You many NOT post work simply to get views or subs!**\n####**2: No solicitation**\n* Solicitation of any kind will not be permitted. This means job listings, crowdfunding, equipment sales/rentals, advertisements or other material deemed solicitous.\n####**3: Remain Polite and Professional**\n* Art is a highly subjective field. As you'd expect then, opinions can sometimes be divisive. However, one would do well to refrain from down-voting, name-calling, insults, flame wars, or other impoliteness or rudeness when interacting with others on the sub.\n####**4: Labeling Posts**\n* In an effort to organize the wide array of posts, the sub will broken up into 7 categories: \n1. Lighting Questions\n2. Camera Questions\n3. Composition Questions\n4. Color Questions\n5. Style/Technique Questions\n6. Original Content\n7. Poll\n8. Other\n* When posting, flair your post with the desired category. If not sure which it should be placed in, choose \"[Other]\". \n* **If you are posting your own work in any capacity, select Original Content**\n####**5: No V-Logs, Travel Videos, or Crowdfunding Submissions**\n* As voted by the community in general, none of the above types of submissions are allowed on this sub. That type of content is not what this sub wants to focus on, and if you're interested in cinematography as a profession then you'd do well to avoid v-logs and travel videos as well!\n####**6: Color Grade Posts must be compared to REC 709, not to Log/flat footage.**\n* Log footage (CLog, sLog, LogC, RedLog, etc) is not meant to be viewed directly. Any posts showing color grade comparisons must compare the grade against a standard Rec 709 LUT.\n####**7: Please do not be a 'Gatekeeper'!**\n* If you're a professional and you see work of a lower quality than your own, please refrain from labeling it as 'videography' or 'amateur' just to put down the OP. Nobody starts out as a pro cinematographer, so do your best at all times to keep an open mind and to help amateurs and students to learn and expand their skills!\n####**8: Students and Amateurs Must Identify Themselves!**\n* If you are a student or an amateur, even an amateur who gets paid sometimes, then please identify yourself when making a self-post! Self-post content will be screened for quality, and unprofessional content submitted by people who don't clarify that they're students or amateurs **will be removed.**\n####**9: Tutorial Videos must be high quality and correct.**\n* Due to an influx of tutorial videos being submitted by amateurs or people who don't understand their own topic, tutorial videos that relay falsehoods or bad info will be removed, and the users submitting them may be banned if they continue to submit bad content.\n####**10: Posts must be about Cinematography! Off-Topic posts will be removed.**\n* If you have a question about filmmaking that isn't quite about cinematography directly, try heading over to /r/filmmakers instead!\n___\n#**RESOURCES**\n* [What Camera Should I Buy?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/6ak5h5/the_best_camera_for/)\n* [Useful film apps](https://www.theblackandblue.com/cinematography-apps/) \n* [Camera menu simulators](https://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/4gqw9g/camera_menu_simulators/)\n* [Advice on show reels.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/4hsn40/discussion_and_advice_on_reels/) \n* [The ditty bag discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/4g55vi/community_post_whats_in_your_ditty/)\n* [Hollywood Reporter Cinematography Round Table 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fzZWP6XgE)\n* [Hollywood Reporter Cinematography Round Table 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iFVM319WRg)\n* [Hollywood Reporter Cinematography Round Table 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2Z4UvAdE7E)\n* [Motion Picture Lens Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U5Dzl4ziFl4SWQyamBj8Z57RIDYsSy4jD5E4CYTENjo/pub?hl=en_GB\u0026amp;hl=en_GB\u0026amp;gid=9)\n* [Matthew Scott who writes a blog showcasing his lighting](http://mattscottvisuals.com/)\n* [Roger Deakins Forums](http://rogerdeakins.com/forums/)\n* [Midwest Filmmaking Grant](https://cameraambassador.com/pages/community-builders-grant)\n* [International Index of Cinematographers](http://www.cinematographers.nl/INDEXA-C.html)\n* [Cinematography.com](http://www.cinematography.com/)\n* [Evanerichards.com (still frames of full films, shows how they're cut together)](http://evanerichards.com/film_index)\n####**Cinematography Societies**\n* [ASC - American](http://www.theasc.com/site/)\n* [BSC - British](https://bscine.com/)\n* [NSC - Netherlands](http://cinematography.nl/)\n* [CSC - Canadian](http://www.csc.ca/)\n* [AFC - French](http://www.afcinema.com/?lang=en)\n* [PSC - Polish](http://en.psc.pl/)\n* [ACS - Australian](http://www.cinematographer.org.au/)\n* [ABC - Brazilian](http://www.abcine.org.br/)\n___"},{"display_name":"awardtravel","description":"/r/awardtravel is a place to discuss anything related to **redeeming** airline miles \u0026amp;

We filter out Etsy, Kickstarter, Pinterest. etc. Linking inside TEXT-posts is usually OK; it allows for more background information to be shared with the community. Review our [Spam] rule (7). Post in the bi-weekly [Buy-Sell-Trade-Promote] thread instead. We post it on Thursdays, you can find it perma-stickied in the top banner. [Or you know, ask us.]*\n3. **If your post is NSFW please first think of others.** *This includes: visible genitalia, swear words in any language, explicit amigurumi.*\n4. **Please -- no memes, pets, cutes, funnies without pattern information.** *Use care with humor and avoid posting memes or pictures without a strong knitting connection. Consider posting to /r/yarntrolls, r/casualknitting, r/drunkknitting or other knitting subs. Make sure to include knitting pattern information (per rule 6) if your picture happens to include a pet with knitting.* \n5. **Yarn/Stash/Notions/Tattoos are for Weekends only.** *RECENT PURCHASES such as Yarn and/or Stash and/or Notions and or pictures of your new knitting tattoo go in the \"Look What I Got\" thread which is posted on Weekends. Because yarn could be used in any sort of fiber craft it is not necessarily knitting specific. Some exceptions for mega-acquisition times (like the holidays) might occur but will be explicitly stated by a moderator.* \n6. **Add yarn and pattern details to the comment section.** *Finished Object [FO] and Works In Progress (WIP) posts should include design and yarn info. Check back to answer questions. Don't post and disappear! Your project can inspire others if they can find the pattern or match the yarn. Put [FO] or [WIP] in [brackets] in your title for automatic flair. DESIGNERS are allowed ONE post per FO and only 1 (one) pattern per week to front page. Contact mods if you have questions or would like your project to receive the Designer FO Flair.*\n7. **SPAM. We're a community, not a bulletin board or marketplace.** *Keep promotional content to the bi-weekly Buy-Sell-Trade-Promote thread. It is posted on Thursdays and can be found perma-stickied in the top banner. The exception is that pattern designers may make 1 (one) post per pattern and only 1 (one) pattern per week. Yarn dyers, spinners, or other related makers should continue to post only in the promotional thread.*\n8. **Respect International Copyright,** *not just US/CA, and do not post pictures of patterns. If you're posting enough of a pattern that a reasonably competent knitter could recreate the item (e.g. entire cable chart for a cabled hat or mittens) that's probably too much. It's probably fair to ask that they only post the portion of the pattern that they absolutely require clarification on.* *Do Not Ask To Share Patterns.** \u0026lt;--This is a bannable offense. When in doubt, [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fknitting).*\n##Our goal:\nTo maintain a vibrant, commerce-free haven for interaction, discovery, and growth through knitting. Promotional links, memes without a significant knitting connection, and images posted without comments or background information may be removed -- but can often be posted in one of the related subs below. \n##Do you want to...? \n* Learn to knit?

If your comment doesn't help, don't comment.\n* Do not post AI generated answers. AI rarely offers anything of value and never provides sources to its claims. By all means use AI to assist, but please investigate its answers and provide your own proof of its claims. Straight copy/paste answers will be removed and the user banned.\n* Do not delete your post after it has been found or commented on by others. You will get at least a temp ban for doing so.\n* Do not repost the same question more than once a week.

If your rule violation(s) are particularly egregious, you will be permanently banned.

Remember, it is your responsibility to know the rules and abide by them.\n \n1. **Be excellent to each other.** More information about this rule is available in the [Rules Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_1).\n1. **Title formatting.** Titles must use the following syntax: `[WTS] (Brand) (Model) (Details)`. Acceptable tags are `[WTS]`, `[WTT]`, and `[WTS/WTT]`. Noncompliant posts will be removed automatically. Circumventing this format will result in a 7-day ban. [More info](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_2).\n1. **Timestamp.** Posts must include a timestamp with your username and the date *handwritten on paper and placed under the watch.* The timestamp date must be within two weeks of the date of your post. Your timestamp must be the first image if you are using an album OR your timestamp must be separately linked. The watch must be visible. [More info](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_3).\n1. **Price and/or trade value required.** Price and/or trade value must be posted on /r/Watchexchange. It is recommended to do so in the comments, as post titles cannot be changed. [More info](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_4).\n \n1. [vacant]\n1. **Reposts are allowed after 7 days.** No early reposts for any reason, including price drops. If you list multiple watches at once, you may not repost the others early after one sells. We recommend listing watches separately. Violation of this rule may result in a 7-day ban. [More info](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_6).\n1. **Transaction feedback**. For sales from a WTS post, feedback can be left on the originating sales post via the flair bot. For sales from the pinned WTB thread, please make a new [WTS] post that includes “RESERVED” in the title. Your post must follow all of the normal subreddit rules *and include a link to the originating [WTB] comment*. Flair shall not be granted for sales originating from outside /r/watchexchange. Instructions on using the flair system can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/wiki/index/confirmingatrade). Only the buyer and seller may leave feedback. For negative or neutral feedback, you may use /r/WatchExchangeFeedback. [More info](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_7).\n1. **No outside sales links, no referral links, and no raffles.** You may reference *completed* eBay listings when discussing price. Referral links of any kind will result in a minimum 7-day ban. Do not link to, discuss, suggest, or otherwise mention raffles. [More info](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_8).\n1. **Price-related comments.** Sellers have the right to ask any price. Users who choose to criticize a seller's price must provide specific examples including links. [More info](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_9).\n \n1. **Fakes and replicas are not allowed.** OEM homages and mods that are substantially based on OEM watches are allowed. If you believe a watch is fake, include proof when commenting. Allegations without evidence may result in a ban. [More info](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_10).\n1. **Giveaways by approval.** Please message the moderation team for approval to post a giveaway with the exact text you will use for the giveaway. Giveaway posts require manual approval. [More info](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_11).\n1. **Requirements for participation.** Your account must have positive karma and be at least 30 days old to post. [More info](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_12).\nTip: \n \n- Make the best picture of your watch the leading image in your post. [Here's how](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/comments/436xh1/tip_use_the_best_image_of_the_front_of_your_watch/d1tin68).\n- Low-effort posts are often removed with no mod comment. If you tried, your post may still get removed but with an explanation. \n- Have your comment with watch info ready to post as a top-level comment before you submit the post. There is no grace period for posting so your post can be removed right after you post it if all the requirements aren't met.\n- If you make a mistake posting, do not delete and repost. Message the mods first or you risk having your post removed and having to wait 7 days to repost. \n**Related:** \n/r/Watches \n/r/EDCexchange \n/r/WatchExchangeFeedback"},{"display_name":"fut","description":"The subreddit for players of FIFA Ultimate Team for Xbox One, PS4, Xbox 360, PS3 and PC.\n##Links\n* [Official Website](http://www.easports.com/uk/fifa/football-club/ultimate-team)\n* [FUTHEAD](http://futhead.com/)\n* [FUTWIZ](http://www.futwiz.com/en/)\n* [FUTScope](http://futscope.com/)\n* [FUTDB](http://futdb.net/)\n* [Pack Simulator](http://futwatch.com/pack-simulator/50.php)\n* [UTT](http://ultimateteamtrading.net/)\n####[Submit Team](http://www.reddit.com/r/FUT/submit?title=[Rate my team] )\n#####[Submit a post](http://www.reddit.com/r/FUT/submit)"},{"display_name":"realmadrid","description":"* [TWITTER](https://twitter.com/realmadridsub \"Follow us!\")\n* [/R/LALIGA](/r/laliga \"Subscribe!\") \n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/realmadrid \"Server\")\n* [OFICIAL](http://www.realmadrid.com \"realmadrid.com\")\n____\n**Useful information:**\n* [Transfer reliability guide](https://rm-reddit.github.io/)\n* [Where to buy tickets](https://www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/wiki/index#wiki_where_to_buy_tickets_for_matches)\n_____\n**FILTERING ONLY WORKS ON OLD REDDIT**\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt;### [HIDE MEME POSTS](//mm.reddit.com/r/realmadrid )\n\u0026gt;###[SHOW MEMES](//www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid )\n___\n \n \n**Rules and Guidelines**\n1.\n**Respect the club, the community and its members**\nPlay nice with each other, there is no need to insult your fellow Madridistas or the visitors.

Hobby Drama-worthy events might have ousted someone from the community, shaped perception of the hobby, altered the rules the hobby uses, divided the community, created a new faction, caused significant outrage, etc. They are not blink-and-you'll-miss-it catfights with no consequences or internet influencers being rude to each other.\n---\n**What is a Hobby Drama post?**\nA high-quality, well thought-out post about a dramatic event in a hobby space. Readers overwhelmingly prefer posts which lay out the history, stakes, events, and consequences of the drama, and which include receipts like screenshots or chat logs. Posts should have minimal direct involvement by the poster and not be overwhelmingly biased, and any personal information of participants who are not public figures must be censored.\n---\n**What is NOT a Hobby Drama post?**\nA short paragraph, one liner, a post directly asking for advice or a post that is fabricated or fictional.

Sources can either be linked in the text or included as a list at the end of the post, or in the comments. If sources are linked in the comments, said comment(s) must be posted as soon as the post goes live.\n**5. Drama must have concluded at least 14 days prior to post**\nThis means there must be concrete conclusions and no new dramatic happenings within the last 14 days and consequences cannot include “it remains to be seen” or “time will tell”. Drama that is fresh and/or ongoing may be posted in the weekly Hobby Scuffles thread.\n**6. Consequences must be detailed**\nPosts must be clear about how the drama impacted the hobby/group/community/etc. Posts without any consequences are boring. Do not use this report reason for Hobby History posts.\n**7. No validation-seeking or awfulbrag posts**\nNo posts where OP either is part of the drama and is saying \"This other person is totally wrong and I was right\" (validation seeking) or caused the drama and is saying \"look how awful I am, I made all this drama happen\" (awfulbrag).\n**8.No low-effort posts / No reposts**\nPosts should include include sufficient detail to be understandable to the reader and written with attention to explaining the situation, the history, and the consequences. Do not repost previously posted content or plagiarise other works. AI-generated content falls under this.\n**9. Influencer / YouTuber / Reddit drama**\nPosts which are not about a hobby should be posted to their respective subreddits, e.g. /r/YouTubeDrama, /r/SubredditDrama, etc.\n**10. Flair non-drama posts as Hobby History**\nNon-drama posts (tales and/or histories about your hobby) must be flaired as Hobby History. Hobby History posts are quality, detailed writeups of interesting non-drama events in your hobby, or drama involving professionals. \n**11. Flair Heavy posts appropriately**\nDrama involving self-harm, abuse, adult content, or other topics which readers may find uncomfortable and wish to avoid must be flared with the Heavy tag.\n**12.Banned Topics**\nThe mods reserve the right to ban discussion indefinitely of any topic that may attract brigading and/or result in unnecessary toxicity.

Though users are welcome to speak Russian, most discussions are in English.\n___\n###Looking to learn Russian? Check out our Wiki, which can be accessed [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/russian/wiki/index).\n___\nJoin the official WhatsApp group by messaging +79787064535!

Discussions about language policy topics, like Russian orthographical reforms and the status of Russian as an official language, are fine.\n## Be civil\nPersonal attacks and other forms of disrespectful conduct aren’t allowed. This includes harassing users elsewhere on Reddit as a result of a disagreement in this subreddit. Disrespectful posts will be removed and may result in a ban.\n## Focus on the Russian language\n/r/russian is a language-learning subreddit, not a place to post anything and everything in Russian. Of course, if you're learning Russian, you're likely to have questions about articles, videos, books, movies, and other works in Russian that you encounter. You may also want to ask native speakers to proofread something you've written. These posts are fine! On the other hand, if you just want to share a funny picture of a cat with a caption in Russian, there are other places to do that. (For memes, funny videos, and adorable animals, try /r/pikabu.)\n## Limit promotional posts\nIf you have a YouTube channel, blog, app, or other resource related to the Russian language that you’d like to share, you’re welcome to post it here. However, we do have some guidelines for promotional posts:\n* Don’t make more than one promotional post every 14 days. Additional posts will be removed.\n* If you make promotional posts, engage with the community in other ways, such as answering questions. Users who post to /r/russian solely for promotional purposes may be banned.\n* Resources promoted on the subreddit should be relevant to Russian learners. Use of the Russian language alone does not establish relevance — for example, Russian-language fashion blogs and gaming channels don’t belong here.\n* Dishonest promotional posts and links to dishonest promotional content (like fake reviews) aren’t allowed.\n* Where applicable, ensure that users can access some portion of your promoted resource without payment. If you’re promoting a series of video lectures or a book, for instance, let users watch one lecture or read one chapter for free.\n## No discussion of piracy\nDon’t request or provide access to unauthorized copies of books, films, music, and other copyrighted works. This includes, but is not limited to, asking for or posting links to free PDFs of commercial textbooks. These posts will be removed, and multiple violations of this rule may result in a ban.\n## No unethical requests\nIf you're studying Russian in school and need help with your homework or exams, don’t ask others to simply do the work for you. These requests are unethical and will be deleted. However, questions about work you've already done are completely appropriate (and even encouraged).\n#Also on Reddit:\n* /r/Moscow — Moscow subreddit.\n* /r/SPb — St. Petersburg subreddit.\n* /r/Russia — Russia's subreddit (in English).\n* /r/RussianLessons — Lessons in Russian.\n* /r/RussianImmersion — Practise your Russian and have your mistakes corrected by the natives.\n* /r/languagelearning - For learners of any language to discuss techniques.\n* /r/russianmusic - Russian music\n* r/RussianLiterature - Russian literature"},{"display_name":"gardening","description":"r/gardening is a place for the best guides, pictures, and discussions of all things related to plants and their care.\nPlease give a general location when asking questions.

The best answers you will get from a resource like this, will come from questions that are more specific than not. There are literally thousands of things to do in Thailand, so, simply asking something like \"what should I do,\" won't help you get a good answer, and won't help us formulate one... be as specific as you can.\n****\n## **Posting rules:**\nPlease note that this is not a general discussion thread.

If you are posting your own content for promotional purposes and have a history of doing so on Reddit, the submission will be removed and you may be banned at the discretion of the moderators.\n\u0026amp;#187; Unrelated news, or other links. Again, this is not a general discussion thread. If you have a news article that is not related to this sub, please do not post it here.\n\u0026amp;#187; Any racist, sexist, intentional trolling, or otherwise offensive content will be removed, and severe occurrences may result in a ban from this subreddit. \n\u0026amp;#187; Reddiquette is followed to the best of our abilities.\n\u0026amp;#187; Posts which include illegal content, including anything that is considered Lèse-majesté in Thailand (insulting or disrespecting The King, the Royal Family and/or the monarchy system in Thailand.)\n\u0026amp;#187; Posts that are intentionally focused on attacking people by race or nationality without reason can and will be removed.

Be Nice To One Another**\nWhile relentless mockery and ridicule of certain conservative pseudo-intellectuals is most certainly allowed, make sure you be civil to one another. This means racial, homophobic, and transphobic slurs, harassment, threatening behavior, doxxing, and general assholishness.\n**2. Low Quality Posts**\nWhile this is a shitpost subreddit, we ~~pride ourselves on~~ *theoretically have* a certain amount of decorum. Pictures of a glow-eyed Ben Shapiro with the title \"When someone says 'feelings'\", are not to be tolerated, and will be removed.\n**3. Staying On Topic/Spam**\nThis subreddit is dedicated to the mockery of Turning Point USA and conservative pseudointellectualism. We are not a subreddit about toilet paper. Posts and comments of this or any such off topic nonsense will be removed.\n**4. Moderator Discretion**\nThe moderators retain the ability to remove posts and/or ban users if they feel it will improve the overall quality of the subreddit. Looking at you, T_D.\n**5. Calls To Action**\nThis subreddit is not intended for the organization of widespread leftist action. While Toilet Paper USA does support such movements, the organization of general strikes and mass protests should be taken to other subreddits, such as r/LateStageCapitalism, r/Socialism, or r/COMPLETEANARCHY.\n**6. Don't be a Fascist**\nIf you walk into a public place and take a big shit on the floor, you're going to get escorted out. For the same reason, we aren't obligated to entertain bad faith right-wing arguments.\n**7. Trolling/Brigading**\nDO NOT engage with brigaders or reactionary trolls. Leave that stuff to the mods, we don't want any flame wars. Instead, just report any troll posts to the mod-team and we'll handle it.\n**8. Real Screenshots**\nTo avoid confusion, please link the original tweet/meme/video/etc if flaired as REAL. The only exception to this rule are photographs that you yourself have taken.\n[**Full Rules and Regulations on our Wiki**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/wiki/rules)\n----\n**Reddit Menu Links**\n[Wiki Index](https://old.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/wiki/index)\n[TPUSA's EPIC Blog!](https://www.desmogblog.com/turning-point-usa)\n[User Flair Guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/wiki/index/flair)"},{"display_name":"PSVR","description":"1.

Read our guidelines prior to posting\nPlease read the community guidelines and familiarize yourself with all of our rules prior to posting. All submissions must relate to Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet. If you have any questions regarding the rules, you can [send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/PokemonScarletViolet).\n###2. Be respectful and follow Reddiquette\nPlease follow the [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) by being civil and respectful at all times. Excessive flaming, harassment, insults, derogatory/disallowed verbiage, posts/comments intended to incite drama and cause conflict, or rants and complaints that aren't constructive in nature will be removed. Repeat offenders will be subject to disciplinary action based on the discretion of the moderation team.\n###3. Tag posts with the correct flair\nWe have a wide variety of flairs available, and posts are required to be flaired prior to submission. Intentionally mislabeled posts may be removed at the discretion of the moderation team. Additional clarification can be sought [via modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/PokemonScarletViolet) prior to posting.\n###4. Use megathreads when applicable\nPlease use the applicable Megathreads. We currently have Weekly Megathreads for Questions, Trade Requests, Online Activities, and Shiny Screenshots. Standalone posts containing content that belongs in a Megathread is considered low-quality/repetitive and will be removed.\n###5. No low-quality or repetitive content\nLow-effort content includes, but is not limited to: Repetitive memes, formats and media posts, simple game questions already answered/belong in a megathread, tier lists, and random game screenshots that don't contain new information or additional context. Also disallowed are standalone trade requests and friend code sharing.\n###6. Context on low-effort memes\nAll submissions must be related to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet outside of just the title. Memes and other humor posts **MUST** include content from the game or the general Pokémon franchise, in some way shape or form, outside of just wording/titles. A meme with only text and non-Pokémon-related visuals/images will be removed for being low-effort.\n###7. No unlicensed or TOS-breaking content / URL Shorteners\nDo not request or post sources linking to unlicensed content aggregation sites. This includes illegal streaming websites, pirated files, etc. We don't allow anything that breaks platform or game TOS.\nPlease refrain from using URL shorteners, and instead use full links. Due to the difficulty of moderating said content, all URL shortening links will be removed automatically.\n###8. Self-promoting content guidelines\nWe only allow non-excessive gameplay clips and full-length videos or articles that can be appropriately tagged with the Guides and tips flair. Promotion of social accounts or products and services is not allowed. Clips have to be uploaded natively to Reddit. Embedded clips or those linked from other platforms are not allowed. Users may upload a maximum of 1 clip per 24 hour period, or 2 full-length videos per week. Ignoring multiple removals under this rule will lead to a permanent ban.\n###9. Credit artists/creators in your submission\nIf you are submitting fanart, comics, guides, memes, videos, or other media that you did not create, you MUST credit the original creator in the title of your submission, as well as provide a link to the source in a comment. Posts that do not meet these guidelines are subject to removal. If you are posting your own artwork, please note as such in either the post title (preferred) or a follow-up comment.\n###10. No standalone shiny pokémon submissions outside of Sunday\n\"Shiny Sunday's\" run from 0:00 UTC on Sunday to 6:00 UTC on Monday. This is the only time period in which standalone posts solely about encountering, catching, or showing off Shiny Pokémon are allowed. **Only posts tagged with the \"Shiny Sunday\" flair have been submitted correctly within the mentioned timeframe.** Outside of this time period, please instead use our Shiny Pokémon Showcase Megathread.\n###11. Keep the subreddit PG-13, no NSFW\nPokémon is a franchise that has fans and players from a wide variety of age ranges. As a result of this, in order to keep the subreddit suitable for general audiences, we do not allow NSFW or overly-suggestive content within our community, even if posted in jest.

Not only will it have better brightness, colour, contrast and viewing angles - you will most probably more than make up the investment when selling it. Corporate bulk purchasers don't usually go for it.\n([Comparison video](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/3dqr2b/x220_ips_vs_tn_new_4k_video/)\\)\n* The only tools you need for servicing a ThinkPad are a set of small screwdrivers and a nylon spudger (for taking the screen and keyboard bezels off), and possibly a pair of tweezers. A can of compressed air may be useful too, and a bottle of isopropyl alcohol and cotton buds are good for cleaning, but not on the screen. Never use nail polish remover (acetone).\n* When reinstalling Windows, try the [Lenovo disc images](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht035659), as longer battery times have been reported, probably due to custom drivers.\n**Useful links:**\n**[The /r/thinkpad FAQ wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/wiki/index)**\n[ThinkPad buyer's guide for n00bs](https://www.bobble.tech/free-stuff/used-thinkpad-buyers-guide)\n[ThinkPad Design - Spirit \u0026amp; Essence](http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/69081166#/69081166/1)\n[ThinkWiki (Linux)](http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkWiki)\n[ThinkPads.com Support Community](http://forum.thinkpads.com/)\n[Lenovo Community Forum](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-Notebooks/ct-p/thinkpad_en)\n[Specification guides for current models](http://psref.lenovo.com/)\n[Specification guides for discontinued models](https://psref.lenovo.com/WithdrawnProducts)\n[Lenovo Outlet (US)](http://outlet.lenovo.com/)\n[Lenovo Parts Removal and Replacement Videos](https://support.lenovo.com/gb/en/solutions/ht505031) (select ThinkPad tab)\n[Lenovo Windows Digital Download Recovery Images](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht103653)\n[YouTube Lenovo Service Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiNzWKyztaaAe6m0yx9ONLw)\n[Mirror of Hardware Maintenance Manuals for discontinued models](http://thinkpads.com/support/hmm/thinkpad-hmm.html)\n[Lenovo Parts Lookup](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/partslookup)\n[Lenovo System Service Parts](https://support.lenovo.com/gb/en/documents/tpad-fru-kr)\n[Lenovo Accessory Compatibility Matrix](http://www.lenovo.com/accessoriesguide)\n[Lenovo Battery Recall](https://support.lenovo.com/gb/en/documents/hf004122)\n[Lenovo Photo Library](https://www.flickr.com/photos/lenovophotolibrary/albums) (including lots of wallpapers)\n[IRC Channel](https://web.libera.chat/##ibmthinkpad) (##ibmthinkpad on Libera)\n**Related Subreddits:**\n/r/lenovo\n/r/laptop\n/r/SuggestALaptop\n/r/LinuxOnThinkPad\n/r/thinkpadsforsale\n/r/thinkpadsetups\n/r/ThinkCat\n/r/thinkpadcirclejerk\n[](/sidebar)"},{"display_name":"analog","description":"#[](https://old.reddit.com/r/analog/comments/1lg9vys/potw_photographer_of_the_week_week_05/)\n###### **Announcement:** Check out the [/r/Analog Instagram!](https://www.instagram.com/redditanalog/) -=- Check out the [Best of the Year 2021](https://old.reddit.com/r/analog/comments/shz7z0/meta_the_ranalog_best_of_2021_awards_winners/) winners!\n###Welcome!\nA subreddit for lovers of analog photography. Share your film photographs and discuss anything analog!\n###Rules - [View in more detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/about/rules/)\n1) Photo posts must include the film stock, lens, and camera used in the post title. If you do not know some of the required information, state that in either the title or top-level comment e.g. [Nikon F3, 50mm f/1.8, Unknown Film], or use [Found Film] for auction/thrift store finds, family photos, and so on. \n2) A maximum of 1 photo post can be shared per day. You may submit multiple images at once in an album, which counts as a single photo post.\n3) No gear/film cache posts, these should go in \\/r/AnalogCommunity\n4) No trading or selling. If you want to do this, please use dedicated communities such as \\/r/photomarket.\n5) Flair NSFW posts e.g. nudity, gore, sex\n6) Constructive criticism of photos is always welcomed here, but personal attacks, brigading, soap-boxing, disrespectful or marginalising the work or its subject are unacceptable.\n6a) Comments complaining about the existence of NSFW posts in a NSFW flaired post are subject to removal, with possible grounds for a ban. This applies to sexualised comments including innuendo. Disable NSFW posts in reddit settings if you do not want them in your feed.\n6b) Bullying users by following them around the subreddit and harassing them will get your comment removed with possible grounds for a ban.\n7) No photos that are digital in origin. Post-processing work is perfectly fine; however, extensive manipulation should be disclosed in the comments.\n8) You must own or have license for images you submit. With image(s) you did not personally take, include the source in the topic title, or a comment if too long for a title.\n9) Do not include social media, website, or crowdfunding links in titles or top-level comments. If someone asks for a link then you can respond to that. Please submit promo links to the Self Promotion thread.\n10) Flair your posts when possible e.g. “Critique Wanted” when specifically wanting critique, “Help Wanted” for questions, etc. Personal subreddit flair can be used for instagram handles, flickr links, etc.\n###\\/r/Analog Wiki\n* [\\/r/Analog Wiki - Index Page](http://www.reddit.com/r/analog/wiki/index)\n* [Camera Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/wiki/camera_reviews)\n* [Camera Repairers](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/wiki/repairs)\n* [B\u0026amp;W Film Processing](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/wiki/bw_processing)\n* [Color (C-41) Film Processing](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/wiki/c41_processing)\n* [Push Processing](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/wiki/push_processing)\n* [Scanning](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/wiki/scanning)\n* [Available B\u0026amp;W Negative Film](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/wiki/bnwnegative)\n* [Available Color Negative Film](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/wiki/colornegative)\n* [Available Slide Film](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/wiki/colorslide)\n* [List of Labs, add your local one](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/wiki/labs)\n* [Photographer of the Week list](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/wiki/potw)\n###Misc. \u0026amp; Social Media\n* [2020 /r/analog Survey](https://forms.gle/F7AUy1wmYpMPkti39)\n* [How To Give Criticism](https://zenhabits.net/how-to-give-kind-criticism-and-avoid-being-critical/)\n* [How To Accept Criticism](https://zenhabits.net/how-to-accept-criticism-with-grace-and-appreciation/)\n* [localdarkroom.com](http://www.localdarkroom.com/countries/index.php)\n* [/r/analog Flickr group](https://www.flickr.com/groups/redditanalog/)\n* [/r/analog Instagram @redditanalog](https://www.instagram.com/redditanalog/)\n###Recurring Threads\n* [Monthly: Self Promotion](http://www.reddit.com/r/analog/search?q=flair%3Acommunity+self+promotion\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all)\n* [Weekly: Gear Photos/Discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/analog/search?q=flair%3Acommunity+%22Gear+Photos%22\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=week)\n* [Weekly: Photographer of the Week](http://www.reddit.com/r/analog/search?q=flair%3Acommunity+%22OTW%22\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;t=all)\n* [Weekly: Ask Anything About Analog](http://www.reddit.com/r/analog/search?q=flair%3Acommunity+%22Ask+Anything+About+Analog+Photography%22\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=week)\n###Related Subreddits\n* Film\n* /r/AnalogCommunity\n* /r/Collodion\n* /r/Darkroom\n* /r/ForgottenFilm\n* /r/PinholePhotography\n* /r/Polaroid\n* /r/SprocketShots\n* /r/ToyCameras\n* General\n* /r/BlackAndWhite\n* /r/FineArtPhoto\n* /r/PhotoMarket \n* /r/Photography\n* /r/PhotoCritique \n* /r/Rangefinders\n###Filters\n* [See Discussion Posts Only](http://www.reddit.com/r/analog/search?q=self%3Ayes\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)\n* [See Photographs Only](http://www.reddit.com/r/analog/search?q=self%3Ano\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)"},{"display_name":"AirForce","description":"Welcome to the United States Air Force subreddit.

Post your own stuff sparingly, and show us only the very best you can do. We're all able to find your blog or channel if we want to see more.\n2. **No advertising**. This subreddit is about *free* resources for learning guitar. Your submission *will* be removed if its main purpose is to get money. The same goes for Kickstarter pages, links to your YouTube channel (as opposed to a specific lesson) etc. See [here](http://www.reddit.com/ad_inq/) for the proper way to promote your stuff on Reddit.\n3. **Flair All Posts**. If you are submitting a lesson, please use link flair to identify it as a Lesson. Link flair can be found underneath the submission's title next to the \"save, hide, delete\" options. \n4. **Don't downvote or mock legitimate questions.** Everybody started somewhere and the main reason we're here is to help. Downvotes are a good way to deal with spam, memes or other irrelevant submissions.

We're not super picky about exact time zones, but we go based off of US times, so as long as it's within a few hours of Friday in the US, you're good to go!

The megathread can be found stickied on the front page of our sub!\n7. **All posts must fit the sub** Posts should fit the theme of the sub and include a lesson, question, Feedback Friday request, or something similar. Images and memes will be removed. \n8. **No Performances or Backing Tracks or Tab Requests** Performances belong in /r/PlayingGuitar, not here (except Feedback Fridays); tab requests are almost never answered, but you can try /r/transcribe or /r/Tabs; chord charts for individual songs are very rarely useful but links to lesser-known tab/chord sites may be.\nNote: Tab requests belong in r/transcribe or r/Tabs; general guitar playing videos belong in other subreddits.\n--------------------------------------\n**User Flair Legend**\n* What is flair?

Whether you are an adjunct, a lecturer, a grad TA or tenured stream if you teach students at the college level, this space is for you! While we welcome students and non-academics lurking and learning, posts and comments are not allowed. If you're new here, please familiarize yourself with the sub rules and follow them. If you're ever unsure, feel free to reach out to the moderators for clarification.\n**Rule 1: Faculty Only.** This sub is intended as a space for those actively engaged in teaching at the college/university level to discuss. As such, we do not allow posts or comments from students or non-academics. For graduate student TAs and others who may find themselves in dual student/instructor roles, we ask that you post here \"as an instructor\" rather than \"as a student\". If you are not a faculty member and wish to discuss topics with us, there are several subs for that purpose, including: /r/AskProfessors, r/AskAcademia, r/gradschool, r/AskStudents_Public, r/academia, etc.\n**Rule 2: No \"Job Search\" Questions.** This includes asking how to become a professor, how to put together your materials, etc. An exception is made for current faculty changing positions / on the market who might have nuanced questions about dealing with challenges in switching universities.\n**Rule 3: No Incivility.** We expect discussion to stay civil even when you disagree, and while venting and expressing frustration is fine it needs to be done in an appropriate manner. Personal attacks on other users (or people outside of the sub) are not allowed, along with overt hostility to other users or people.\n**Rule 4: No Bigotry.** Racism, sexism, homophobia or other forms of bigotry are not allowed and will lead to suspensions or bans. While the moderators try not to penalize politically challenging speech, it is essential that it is delivered thoughtfully and with consideration for how it will impact others. Low-effort \"sloganeering\" and \"hashtag\" mentalities will not be tolerated.\n**Rule 5: No Inappropriate Content.** We do not allow posts about sexual fantasies, discussions of crushes, dating students/faculty, or anything of a similar nature.\n**Rule 6: No Spam.** If you're posting the same article to multiple subs, or copying and pasting the same content, you can expect it to be removed and repeated violations will result in suspensions or bans. This includes advertising your own or others content.\n**Rule 7: No Surveys.** Our default is that no surveys are allowed. We will occasionally make exceptions for surveys that are IRB approved, are posted by a faculty member, and specifically target users in this community. If you feel your survey meets these criteria, reach out via ModMail and we will consider it. Polls using the built-in functionality are perfectly acceptable.\n**Rule 8: No Blind Links.** If you post a link to an article, your post title must be the same as the article you are linking to, with an allowance for parenthetical contextualization at the end (e.g., country or school). As this is a discussion forum, authors should provide some starting discussion on the article in question that introduces the article and establishes context and relevance for the readers of the sub. Links with no context from the poster will likely be considered spam (*See Rule #6*)."},{"display_name":"flipperzero","description":"Flipper Zero is a portable multi-tool for pentesters and geeks in Tamagotchi body.

However, please take note of Rule #1 and when reporting be reasonable and fair. Anyone abusing the reporting mechanism may be banned.\n**1) Be kind to others.** Above anything else. Opinions posted are reflective only of the person posting them. You are entitled to your opinions, but remember that they are entitled to theirs. Be respectful, and don’t allow disagreements to devolve into personal attacks. Hate speech, sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc. will not be tolerated. Breaking this rule may result in a ban.\n**2) No spam**/advertising/self-promotion allowed. What qualifies? Read about it here: https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion. We moderate by these rules. Spammers may be subject to a ban. If you are posting a **Resource** that is **free** make sure it is stated in your post. Links to products or sites that require pay, as well as resources behind paywalls or that require registration are frowned upon unless there is free access of some sort as well. If in doubt, please contact the Mod Team before posting.\n**3) No homework help** on specific assignments. It is against the Academic Honesty Policy of most schools and courses. Our subscribers generally dislike this kind of behavior. Please ask your IRL teacher/tutor for homework help instead. It's important that we get such posts taken down ASAP, so in addition to reporting, please message the Mod Team if you see someone breaking Rule #3.\n**4) No off topic posts.** Posts not about Music Theory or Music Theory adjacent topics do not belong here. Questions about Composing, Orchestration, Songwriting, Music Production, Audio Engineering, as well as specific questions about Instruments (playing technique) are best asked on or at least cross posted to other forums. We’re here to talk about the Music Theory! How relevant a topic may be is up to the discretion of the Mod Team. Check below for a list of other Music subs where your question may be more appropriate.\n**5) Image/Video comment violation.** This is a discussion board, not Instagram! For image/video posts it is required that you write your question or engage in discussion in the image's frame or as a comment post or both (i.e. **not just the title** of your post!). Posts without this additional comment included will be removed.\n**6) Image/Video clarity violation**. For image/video posts we must be able to clearly see the details as well as the larger context! For videos/audio you **must include a time stamp**. Please make sure your image has some means of identifying what you're talking about in image (a highlight, red circle, etc.) or text (clearly stated in your comment) as well as giving readers the larger context (including the key signature, time signature, links to other images or audio, etc.). Posts without enough detail, fuzzy images, lack of important content etc. may be removed at the Mod Team's discretion.\n**7) No controversial posts.** Posts or comments that only serve to create drama, bait trolls, cause controversy or other negative reactions, **whether intended or otherwise**, will be removed at the Mod Team's discretion. Please note that there are some topics that will - while completely on topic or otherwise meritorious of discussion - create an unproductive atmosphere we do not want to promote on r/musictheory. Political, religious, or otherwise controversial topics are best posted elsewhere.

Treat everyone with respect and engage in good faith.\r\n* All content must be either Nintendo news from the original source or discussion about Nintendo games, systems and products.\r\n* Discussion should be open-ended and seek different opinions. Content with neither context to inform nor prompts for discussion are not substantial enough for a post.\r\n* Posts should have clear, descriptive titles that properly convey what the content is.\r\n* Don't be shady. No buying, selling, trading, or begging. No affiliate/referral links. No enabling piracy or sharing illegal content.\r\n* All giveaways and contests must either be held by Nintendo or approved in advance by messaging the moderators.\r\n* For your own safety always wear a wrist strap when browsing Reddit.\r\n\r\nOur moderation policy is not to keep track of every rule infraction, and everything is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. However, we do ban users who make personal attacks or buy/sell/beg. We will try to tell you how you can resubmit, or recommend a more a suitable subreddit. However, please read other subreddits' rules before submitting there.\r\n\r\nPlease be considerate when discussing plot details for games new or old. Don't put spoilers in post titles at all.

All top level comments must be longer than simply a sentence or two, barring questions and some exceptions. Back up your opinions with details and examples. A comment should always further the discussion in some way, whether it be through adding onto the original post, contributing new information, offering an opposing viewpoint, etc.\n---\n* OP must get the discussion going\n* Try to engage in intriguing conversation. Trivial and uninteresting threads may be deleted. New topics must aim to start a discussion. Posts should include in-depth questions and analytical opinions. Threads like \"I like band x, do you?\" or \"Help me get into band y\" don't belong here. \"DAE\" posts invite yes/no answers and do not stimulate discussion! If your contribution has been deleted and you feel peeved, feel free to let us know. Most removed posts can be resubmitted successfully by making the topic more discussion oriented.\n---\n* Some list threads are allowed\n* List threads have grown popular here and have generated a lot of good discussion and content. We encourage list threads ONLY if they are in-depth and generate parent replies with quality content. You must also **tag your post** with '[list]' at the beginning of the title! Mods reserve the right to lock / remove any threads that they deem do not fit these criteria. Low-effort parent replies will be removed with extreme prejudice.\n---\n* No recommendation threads\n* Unless there is a deeper level of discussion to the question, recommendation threads should be put in the general discussion post or in the chatroom.\n---\n* Provide links\n* If you mention a song or an album in a comment, please take the time to add a Youtube link or a streaming playlist, so readers can easily check them out. Mentioning music without linking to the music is difficult for someone who is not familiar with it.\n---\n* No filesharing\n* /r/letstalkmusic is not the place to solicit or post links to illegal music downloads. Filesharing is not allowed here!\n---\n* No self-promotion\n* This isn't the place to promote yourself, your podcast, or your channel. If you have a blog post or essay, you may make a post with it, but you must include the entire contents of the post/essay in the post here. Users should not have to go to your website to join the conversation. Also, don't include a link to your blog etc.\n---\n* No therapy threads\n* Posts about your own mental health and relationship issues as they pertain to music in general (e.g. \"I can't enjoy music anymore\", \"There's too much music; how do I keep up?\", \"Where can I find friends who like the same music as me?\") are not allowed. Neither the mods or the users of this sub are in a position to give you good advice on these questions; please find a sub more suited to discussing mental health and relationships.\n---\n* Be nice\n* Direct insults to other members of the sub probably won't be tolerated. We mods aren't as touchy as some of you, but we'll use our own judgment.\n---\n###*Let the moderators know of any suggestions and complaints you have through moderator mail, not PM.*\n#Subreddit Goals\n##This is a community for people who are passionate about music.

We **will not** remove a post for not including stats, as we respect people's privacy decisions and encourage everyone to participate.

We hope you are able to benefit from and contribute to our community of law school applicants. In order to cut down on spam and trolling, new members to r/lawschooladmissions and Reddit may have their posts automatically filtered for manual review based on a variety of account factors. If you believe your post was filtered and is still not approved after 24 hours, feel free to send a message to the mods. Thank you!\n**Retakes**\nRetakes are a no brainer in these circumstances:\n* You scored at the low end of your PT average\n* Your scores were still increasing in the weeks up to test day\n* You had less than perfect on logic games\nIf none of these are true for you, and you're clearly stalled, then make this clear. Most people posting have retake potential.\nEven 2-3 points can make a large difference in admissions/scholarships. That's why so many people here post \"retake!\" to a lot of situations.\n**Canada?** Most people here are US. So most advice doesn't apply. Feel free to ask questions, though, there are some Canadians. Big differences:\n* Almost no scholarships. \n* Most schools are pretty good.\n* Go where you want to practice\n* GPA is significantly more important. Do all you can to raise it.\n* For god's sake don't go abroad. That's Canada's TTT."},{"display_name":"autism","description":"_______\nAutism news, information and support. Please feel free to submit articles to enhance the knowledge, acceptance, understanding and research of Autism and ASD. \nBy posting here you agree to all rules and reddit's terms of service.\n___\nPlease refrain from using slang or derogatory words to describe a condition, symptom, diagnosis or treatment that is negative and hurtful. This includes name calling. Your post **will** be removed and lead to you being banned. Please review Reddiquette when needed. \nIt is acceptable to introduce the community to your personal site. Further continued submissions will be reviewed as abuse.\n___\n**Rules:**\n*Check our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/wiki/index) before posting with questions. If your question is answered in the wiki, your post will be removed.*\n* No personal attacks, hostility, or escalating arguments - be kind.\n*Personal attacks do not contribute to a discussion and only result in creating an unwelcome environment, do not act with hostility towards other users or escalate arguments. Please also be aware that in a largely autistic space, miscommunication and misunderstanding between people is likely to occur, and some comments may come across as rude or offensive without being intended that way. If you're uncertain how to interpret somebody's comments, try asking them to clarify what they mean.*\n* No sharing pseudoscience or spreading misinformation, no Autism Speaks, no cure-related posts.\n*Posting pseudoscience or spreading misinformation is not allowed. Sharing content from or creating discussion around harmful organisations such as Autism Speaks is not allowed. Asking for opinions on an autism cure or speculating on alternative causes of autism outside of the scientific research into ASD causes is not allowed.*\n* No self-diagnosis debate or discussion, no making arguments in favour of or opposing self-diagnosis.\n*Debate surrounding self-diagnosis, or posts asking for opinions on self-diagnosis, is not allowed. This includes both advocating for or against self-diagnosis. The topic is exhausted, too frequently brought up, while no meaningful discussion on the topic takes place and conversation quickly spirals into chaos.*\n* No asking for diagnosis or medical advice for yourself or someone else, no \"Am I autistic?\" posts.\n*Please don't ask for a diagnosis for yourself or for another person, or word a post in a way that can be interpreted as asking for validation. We cannot diagnose you or offer you advice on medical grounds. Concerns about your health are best discussed with your GP, physician or another qualified health provider. Taking medical advice from strangers who lack the necessary expertise or ability to objectively evaluate you is potentially dangerous.*\n* No posting online test results, such as the RAADS-R or AQ.\n*Please don't post results of online tests to the subreddit. Tests such as the RAADS-R, AQ and Aspie Quiz are intended to be used as clinical screeners only to determine if it's worthwhile for a practice to take a person on for a full evaluation, they are not diagnostic tools and their results cannot reliably indicate if a person is autistic or not, nor are there results able to be reliably interpreted outside of a clinical setting.*\n* No sharing posts or media with usernames or identifying information. No posting images of children.\n*Please don't share images, posts or screenshots containing visible usernames or any form of personal identifying information. Don't post images of children.*\n* No clickbait or vague post titles, no spamming, no posts titled with emojis or symbols.\n*Please ensure posts have a descriptive title that details exactly what the submission is about, vague posts and clickbait where the title does not accurately reflect the main post content may be removed to avoid causing confusion. Posts consisting of emojis and symbols only will also be removed.*\n* Correctly flag NSFW topics, and be mindful of the presence of young people on the sub.\n*If you're posting about an NSFW topic or asking a question of that nature, please make sure you have correctly marked it as such. The subreddit has a large number of younger people using it, and posts must be mindful of their presence. You can provide context to the question in the title, but don't be overly explicit.*\n* No highlighting arguments within other subreddits or continuing arguments across other subreddits.\n*Please don't post about arguments that occurred within other subreddits or draw attention to other subreddits with the intention of directing people's attention there. Likewise please don't engage in arguments with members of other subreddits or follow them around other subreddits to argue there.*\n* No advertising, marketing, asking for donations, or promoting fundraisers.\n*Please don't make posts attempting to solicit financial transactions or advertise products for sale. Don't post requesting personal donations or promoting fundraising efforts. We have no way of verifying if such donations or fundraisers are legitimate, and we can't endorse taking potential financial risks that may have real-world consequences for subreddit members.*\n___\nIf you want to do an AMA please do it in /r/IAmA or /r/casualiama.

No Snark or Condescension**\n\u0026gt;This is a sub for Poshmark sellers (and buyers) to come and share about the funny and sometimes bizarre \"life behind the closet door\". It's a place for lighthearted fun, or to share victories, or maybe complain, or get/give support, advice and tips. If you don't have a sense of humor, this probably isn't the sub for you. Any excessive rude, snarky, condescending or holier-than-thou stuff won't be tolerated.\n**2. Don't Spam the Sub!**\n\u0026gt; No spamming the sub. Do not post advertisements to your closet without moderator permission (in most cases, the answer will be NO), promote youtube, blogs, instagram, facebooks or personal websites etc., post the same question or post repeatedly, make comments telling people they are spamming the sub - if you see an issue, use the report button \u0026amp; leave the moderating to the moderation team.\n**3. Be kind. Be a good person. We're all just people..**\n\u0026gt; Be a good person. We're all just people..\nNo bullying, derogatory comments or toxic behavior of any kind will not be tolerated. Don't be that person. No hate speech, harassment, racism, sexism bigotry or personal attacks. Just don't. This is a zero-tolerance rule. Nobody likes bullies or assholes. Also - No Witchhunts Please block/redact all personal information on screenshots/posts and do ever not ask for personal information. Any of the above will get you banned.\n**4. Rants Ok. Whiny, moaning, poor me every day? Nah**\n\u0026gt; Rants are ok, and we all need a safe, supportive place to vent where we won't be judged. We all have things and experience things that piss us off or drive us nuts, but let's keep it to a reasonable amount. Repetitive rants or using \"Rant\" or \"Rant Over\" are a little peevy so try to refrain.\n**5. This ain't tea with The Queen**\n\u0026gt;Passionate people are awesome. They make life interesting. So..\"Swearing\". If this bothers you? This probably isn't your jam. \"Bad\" words are just letters, plucked from the alphabet \u0026amp; strung together like any. other. words. We are the ones that give them power \"FUCK\" - in it's many beautiful forms- is so versatile, descriptive, EMPHATIC and also a personal favorite This is the internet. Not school, your granny's kitchen or High Tea w/The Queen Have a feeling! Enhance your sentences! Swear it up.\n**8. No PM's Asking for Redacted/Personal Info**\n\u0026gt; There's a reason we have a rule against exposing anyone's personal info. I wish we didn't have to do it, but we do, as per Reddit. No one should be undercutting this rule by asking an OP or ANY OTHER member for the redacted information. It's shitty. It's annoying. And we won't tolerate it if we hear of it. Just laugh, comment, or say whatever and move the fuck on. Surely you have something to be listing? ;)\n**9. No Flippant Downvoting. Think Before You Click**\n\u0026gt;We understand the point of upvotes/downvotes, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. Actually I use the Upvote option quite a lot. Downvoting should be reserved for those that TRULY deserve it. I mean, trolls? Yes of course. Someone says something mean or hurtful? Yes! But it's WAY overused and it's really kind of useless/hurtful. So before you click that down arrow, think hard about whether it's just not your opinion/you just don't \"like\" it, or if it's truly morally wrong and/or mean-spirited\n**10. No Brag Posts**\n\u0026gt;Don't brag about your 15 sales last week. It makes people who are hustling \u0026amp; trying, but didn't make any sales feel bad. Poshmark sales are finicky \u0026amp; can mean different things to different people. Just don't do it. Be nice \u0026amp; uplift people.\n**11. Buying \u0026amp; Selling on this sub is At Your Own Risk**\n\u0026gt;You may advertise your closet with moderator permission, you may ask another seller you see on this subreddit for their closet so you can buy from them. HOWEVER: This subreddit \u0026amp; its moderators are not responsible \u0026amp; will not get involved in any issues that may arise. We would not expect a BTCDer to scam another, but we cannot become involved in buy/sell issues. If you have an issue, take it up with Poshmark. If you didn't use Poshmark \u0026amp; are mad you got scammed, thats on you.\n**12. Not my Monkeys, Not my Circus**\n\u0026gt; This sub is for discussing buying and selling on poshmark and other selling apps. Do not bring your drama from another sub here. We don’t care. Hate another sub? Cool. Keep that shit to yourself. No brigading.

[More information here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/5fcznd/announcement_of_tracker_the_new_day_counter/) To get a day counter, you must connect with a browser, not the Reddit app. Once you have set up your day counter, you may continue using the Reddit app.\n**Introduction** NoFap® is a moderated community-centered website that hosts challenges in which users (\"Fapstronauts\") abstain from pornography and masturbation for a period of time (often referred to as \"rebooting\"). This is NoFap's subreddit hosted right here on Reddit.com! Whether your goal is casual participation in a monthly rebooting challenge as a test of self-control, or whether excessive pornography use has become a problem in your life and you want to quit for a longer period of time, you will find a supportive community and plenty of resources here. \nThis forum is intended for *porn addiction and compulsive sexual behavior recovery* and is not an anti-masturbation forum: many users return to non-compulsive masturbation after removing porn from their sexual habits. We do not advocate against masturbation. However, *excessive* masturbation (usually fueled by porn use) can be an issue for many people, and we're here to provide a peer support resource for recovery from problematic pornography use. But remember, how you choose to utilize your genitals during your free time is a personal choice!\n**New Fapstronauts**\n * *Learn about what's going on in your brain.* This is important so that you know what to expect during a reboot. Our [Porn Addiction 101 page](http://www.nofap.com/porn-addiction) is a great place to get started. NoFap also has a [Getting Started](http://www.nofap.com/getting-started) guide. This includes information about porn addiction, sexual dysfunctions caused by porn such as \"PIED\", disinterest in real-world sex, and the inability to experience a partnered orgasm. Our friends over at YBOP have a great [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU) on the subject that we *highly* recommend watching. If you need something that's shorter, check out this [basic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ya67aLaaCc) by ASAPScience. For further resources to learn more about porn addiction, see our [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/wiki/index) page for other websites, videos, and resources to help you on your rebooting journey.\n * Learn about the process of abstaining from PMO, also known as \"rebooting.\" If you don't know what to expect from abstaining from porn and masturbation, there are a number of things that might throw you off. Learn about rebooting and how NoFap can help you on [NoFap's Rebooting 101 page](http://www.nofap.com/rebooting). *It is imperative* to learn about concepts such as the \"flatline\", the \"surge\", the \"chaser effect\", and more. Please get educated and don't enter this daunting process completely blind to what might happen.\n * We recommend [visiting with an appropriately qualified therapist](https://nofap.com/articles/how-to-find-a-therapist/) in your area who is familiar with porn addiction and problematic porn use.\n * Get a feel for the community before participating. Afterward, a good first step is to share your story with us. [Post a new thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/submit?selftext=true).\n * This forum is for anyone - men and women and other gender identities - the only requirements are being a human and wanting to develop healthier sexual habits. If you are a woman who wants a private community, check out the [women's forums](https://nofap.com/forum/index.php?forums/women-in-reboot.22/).\n * Get an accountability partner, someone who will hold you accountable during your reboot. Post a thread here or [on the forums](http://www.nofap.com/forum/index.php?forums/accountability-partners.7/).\n * Choose your own reboot. *NoFap's Standard Reboot:* No edging, no porn, no masturbating. *\"Hard Mode\":* No edging, no porn, no masturbating, no orgasming whatsoever. *Lite Mode:* No porn. For more information on the programs, check out NoFap's [Rebooting 101](http://www.nofap.com/rebooting) page.\n * Sign up for a reboot challenge by replying to a the official sign up thread. These are usually \"stickied\" as the first post or linked on the sidebar. It is up to yourself to remain accountable, although we're working on developing a more motivating solution.\n * If you come across a word or acronym that you don't understand, we have a [glossary of terms](http://www.nofap.com/glossary) commonly used in the rebooting community.\n * Obtain a counter next to your name with Tracker.\n * [Read our full disclaimer and rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/wiki/rules) before posting or participating in one of our rebooting challenges. \n * If you are feeling suicidal or want to self-harm, [contact a prevention hotline](http://suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html) immediately.

What does AI mean? Find out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/6i91sh/welcome_to_rartificial/)!\n****\n**Guidelines**:\n**Check New Reddit for updated rules - here is the link -https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/about/rules, and do not complain to us in Modmail if you get banned.**\nSubmissions should generally be about Artificial Intelligence and its applications. If you think your submission could be of interest to the community, feel free to post it.\nPlease note that just because something else is a technology buzzword (e.g. blockchain, quantum computing, virtual reality, augmented reality, etc.), that doesn't automatically make it AI. We've had such a problem with blockchain posts that they will now need to be manually approved by a mod before they become visible. If your post is primarily about another technology (like blockchain), please make the relation to AI abundantly and immediately clear (e.g. through writing a comment). \nAll submissions are moderated through \"collaborative filtering\" approach. To help better align content with the expectations of the audience and improve the quality of the subreddit, submissions that receive overall negative feedback may be removed.\nSubmission titles should clearly indicate what the submission is about. In the case of link posts, they should almost always contain the title of the thing you're linking to. Don't make up your own clickbait title, and if the original title is clickbait, please add some nuance of your own. For example, if the link you want to post is to an article called \"You won't believe what AI did this time!\", then 1) consider if it's really a quality article, and 2) create a title like this: \"A neural network gets superhuman performance on \u0026lt;insert task\".\nWhen posting about a story, please look on the front page if it is already being discussed. If so, consider replying there instead of making a new submission to the subreddit. If not, please make some effort to post the best link to the story you can find (often this is the story from the original source, rather than some outlet repeating what someone else already reported). \nConsider doing a little research before posting a link, opinion or question. For link posts, consider writing a submission statement: a comment that describes what the link is about, why you posted it, what you'd like to discuss, and/or what you think about it. \nRead Rule 2 on New Reddit for our self-promotion rule.\nDo not personally attack other people (here or elsewhere; including e.g. researchers you disagree with). If you see someone do this (e.g. to you), use the report button and do not retaliate. If you disagree with anything, stick to the arguments.\n****\n**Getting started with Artificial Intelligence**\nLooking to get started with AI? Check out [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/wiki/index#wiki_getting_started_with_ai)!\n****\n**Interested in doing an AMA?**\nWe offer an opportunity for experienced people and companies working on interesting problems in AI to talk to the community about their work and experience in the field through an [AMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit#IAmA_and_AMA) (Ask Me Anything): Reddit's version of an interview where users can ask you questions.

Please feel free to join the conversation, discuss experiences, or ask for help. \n------\n**Rules:**\n1) **No referral links/codes**. Do not offer or ask for referral codes. Do not post your link/code here. Do not link to another site or subreddit where you have posted your referral link/code.\n2) **No spam, marketing, market research, or self-promotion**. Even without referral links, advertising another site where you can get financial benefit (from ads, sales, or otherwise) is not allowed. This also includes market research and focus group-style testing of products and services. If you have good advice to share, then copy it here in full so that the community can benefit. (Exceptions may be made at the mods' discretion for bona fide non-profit groups and other particularly helpful resources.)\n3) **No crowdfunding**. Do not request funding or co-signing of your debt. Do not offer to pay or co-sign another's debt here, regardless of method. This community is for advice and discussion, not to facilitate transfer of money.\n4) **No advocating default**. As an advice community, our primary goal is helping people work to improve their situation through legal means, including honoring their valid contracts. Sometimes default is unavoidable, in which case we'll provide support and advice for managing it, but this is not the place to advocate intentional default or get advice about defaulting on purpose.\n5) Do not post **private details or direct contact information** for loan servicer employees, ED employees, or anyone else that's not officially available.\n6) Before posting any kind of **survey, call for interviews, or request for personal information**, [get moderator approval](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/StudentLoans).

Mods will be vigilant in ensuring personal opinion doesn't cloud the facts. While every attempt will be made by the mods to ensure the information provided and opinions voiced will be relevant and accurate, you should **ALWAYS** read the fine print for any loan you are considering.\nYou should **never** have to pay for help with your student loans.

Read me!](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1km5oa/new_to_this_sub_read_this_message_for_a_brief_tour/) \n[Our Wiki Page](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/wiki/index)\nThis subreddit is for discussion and dissemination of the science behind haircare products and processes. We aim to provide information and resources to achieve better hair quality through scientific research in trichology, physiology, chemistry, and biology. \n \n-----\n[see front page without Advice Request posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/search?q=-flair%3AAdvice%2BRequest\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=relevance\u0026amp;t=day)\n--------\n**Subreddit Rules** \n1. **Source your facts** - If you're making a statement of fact, you must provide a scientific source. If the information comes from somewhere non-scientific (your experience, a blog), you must make that clear and not frame the statement as fact. Do not tell others to look things up for themselves - the burden of proof is on the person who first posts something. Read more about what qualifies as a source [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/m49hyj/haircare_science_research_guide_part_1_what/)\n \n2. **We are not your doctor** - Do not ask for a diagnosis or attempt to give one to anyone else. If you want to ask about a particular condition it must be in an impersonal way and it must not ask for how to diagnose.\n \n3. **Advice requests must be specific** - Requests for personal haircare advice must have a specific question in the post title. Vague requests (“what’s wrong with my hair?\" \"Give me product recommendations”) will be removed. Please post general requests for help/recommendations in the stickied Haircare Advice megathread, or rewrite this post to have a more specific question. Read more about what makes a post specific vs. vague [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/mnkzdc/updates_to_subreddit_rules_guidelines/)\n \n4. **No repetitive posts** - In order to keep the subreddit uncluttered, questions that are frequently posted will be removed. Before posting, use the search bar first to see if your question has already been discussed.\n5. **This is a science subreddit** - This is not the place to ask for styling preferences - try other hairstyling subreddits for that. Pseudoscience, chemophobia, or other anti-science rhetoric will be removed and repeat offenders banned.\n6. **No advertising** - Advertising a product without any scientific discussion is prohibited. If you are affiliated with any product you must disclose your relationship. You may discuss your products as long as you have disclosed your relationship and have been flaired as a product representative. Product recommendations are allowed as long as it is not repetitive and you do not ask to take the conversations to DM or post affiliate links. We have a zero tolerance policy for advertising or promoting MLMs.\n7. **Be respectful** - Scientific arguments may sometimes occur, but always treat other users with respect. No harassment/racism/sexism/etc. will be tolerated. If you are combative or rude when others ask you to provide sources, you may be banned. This rule also applies to your communication with the mod team.\n8. **No asking for advice on balding or hair loss of any kind.** - If you have any questions about hair loss, balding or thinning please consult a medical professional. Other subreddits you might be interested in include r/tressless and r/askdocs.\n9. **This is not a product review sub.** - Product ingredient lists don't really tell us much about the product; formulation matters. If you're looking for product reviews, try another sub, or google it. \n Same applies to posts asking for dupes of a specific product. Posts asking for help checking a product ingredient list for \"harsh\" or \"harmful\" ingredients will be removed as it promotes chemophobia.\n10. **This is not a hair coloring or styling sub.** - For hair color advice, try r/hairdye or r/fancyfollicles. For hair styling advice, start at r/hair.\n11. **This is not a DYI sub.** - There is a perfectly good DIY subreddit, r/DIYbeauty. Post homegrown product questions and other DYI fair product questions to that sub.\n-----\n**Asking Advice?** \n \n1. Read the articles in the sidebar first - they may answer your question\n2. Have a concrete question. Posts that only ask what is \"wrong\" with one's hair or what products to use without any information about why you're asking this question are subject to removal. \n3. Include details about your hair type and existing haircare routine. \n-----\n**Get Special Flair!**\nTo apply for user flair, fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdLCum7xdrl4UaMyoVi9pviUZKTxfTHhHwcC9G7Fi53rMJdDQ/viewform)\n- If you make **several well-cited comments**, you can get special flair to distinguish you as a knowledgable hair person. Gives you extra credibility! \n- Are you a **professional stylist**? Show the mods proof of your occupation and we can give you special stylist flair.\n- If your posting history indicates that you are **a company or product representative**, you need to be assigned brand representative flair in order to post about your products on this subreddit. \n------\n**Resources**\n[Beginner Haircare Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1km6dx/basic_haircare_guide/)\n[Other Basic Care Guides](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/wiki/beginner_haircare_guides)\n[Info on Advanced Topics](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/wiki/specific_topics)\n[Specific Ingredient Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/wiki/ingredient_guide)\n[HCS's Dictionary of Terms](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1lxme9/hcs_dictionary_of_terms/)\n[Alphabetical List of All HCS Guides](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/wiki/all_guides)\n-----\n**More Information** \n[International Journal of Trichology Archive](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/journals/1279/) \n[UK Institute of Trichologists](http://www.trichologists.org.uk/)\n \n[North American Hair Research Society](http://nahrs.org/Publications/Publications%28Archive%29.aspx) \n[*Chemical and Physical Behavior of Human Hair* by Clarence R.

If you can make a Reddit post you can send them an email. We are not here to do your homework for you.\n* **4. No doxxing.** Do not try to find any of our users in real life. Do not ask any users to reveal their identities, or any identifying information to you. Do not link to other social media accounts. Do not post any identifying information of anyone else on this sub.\n* **5. We do not condone professor/student relationships.** Questions about relationships that are asked in good faith will be allowed - though be warned we do not support professor/student relationships - but any fantasy fiction (or similar content) will be removed.\n* **6. No spam.** No spam, no surveys. We are not here to be used for any marketing purposes, we are here to answer questions. We equally are not here to perform free labour in evaluating your new software or tool that you are hoping to sell. This applies to any and all AI programs you may have developed.\n* **7. Posts must contain a question.** Your post must contain some kind of answerable and discernible question, with enough information that users will be able to provide an effective answer.\n* **8. We do not condone nor support plagiarism.** We are against plagiarism in all its forms. Do not argue with this or try to convince us otherwise. Comments and posts defending or advocating plagiarism will be removed.\n* **9. We will not do your homework for you.** It's unfortunate that this needed to be its own rule, but here we are.\n* **10. Undergrads giving advice need to be flaired.** Sometimes students will have valuable advice to give to questions, speaking from their own experiences and what has worked for them in the past. This is acceptable, as long as the poster has a flair indicating that they are not a professor so that the poster is aware the advice is not coming from an authority, but personal experience.\n***\n**Other subreddits**\n* r/AskAcademia is a general forum for posing questions to anyone in academia, including professors of all levels, graduate students, administration etc.\n* r/College is the place to go for general discussion on life as an undergraduate student.\n* r/CommunityColleges does much the same as the above but specifically for two-year institutions.\n* r/gradadmissions for all your questions about the graduate school admissions process\n* r/GradSchool for anything related to (post)graduate education\n* r/HomeworkHelp is a subreddit dedicated to helping students with their homework. \n* r/Professors is a community for faculty members. Please be advised it is a subreddit intended for professors to ask other professors questions. Questions from students are more appropriate here at r/AskProfessors.\n* r/StudentAffairs is dedicated to college \u0026amp; university programs that encourage student development outside the classroom."},{"display_name":"AO3","description":"**Celebrating AO3, the OTW, and fandom on Reddit!**\nThis subreddit is dedicated to the website [archiveofourown.org (AO3)](http://archiveofourown.org/). AO3 is a database project of Organization for Transformative Works that hosts fanworks (fanfiction, podfics, fanart, etc).\nPlease note: this subreddit is *not* official or sanctioned by the admin of AO3. Some of the moderators or commentors *may* be volunteers but anything a volunteer says here is their own and not official. The best place to get official help with AO3 is by contacting the [Support team via their form on the bottom of any page.](https://archiveofourown.org/support)\nFeel free to modmail us any suggestions or comments!\n**Rules:**\n* **Flairs Required** - Every post has to have a correct flair. Report posts with incorrect flairs and we’ll fix the flair. Correct flair helps with searching/sorting/only seeing the kinds of posts you are interested in.\n* **Use the Megathreads** - We have megathreads for Self-promotion/Reccomendations, Invite requests, and sometimes other special topics or events. Please keep these topics to their respective megathreads. We won't be allowing individual posts on these topics.\n* **Personally Identifying Information** - Please do not include personally identifying information (usernames, titles, photos of a person's face, etc) in your posts or comments outside of a work finding request or recommendation.\n* **Don't search for works from here** - Please do not try to find works mentioned in the subreddit (outside of work search posts of course) using the limited details in the posts. This is a form of brigading and keeps causing harassment issues and/or mass reporting problems. If someone breaks this rule by commenting on the work on AO3, please report it via modmail, not by reporting the post that lead to it with the report system. (We won't ask how you found out about said comment) Obviously doesn't apply to promo/exchange threads.\n* **Commercial Promotion/Solicitation Rule** - It's generally not allowed but some kinds of discussions are. See [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/AO3/comments/17w0308/rule_update_commercial_promotionsolicitation/) for the actual details.\n \n* **Fic/Work Search Rule** - Please make your own post to look for a fic/work. Do not comment to ask people to help you find a fic/work on another person's post. It clutters things and makes it harder for everyone.\n* **Spam Comment/Webnovel Posts Moratorium** We are imposing a ban on making posts sharing that you got one of the webnovel spam comments. We are not banning posts asking about them though. This is just a ban on the posts where the OP clearly knows about the issue already and is just posting that they got one. \n \n* **Moratorium on AI posts/comments** - Only posts about actual updates related to AI (either affecting AO3 or things like copyright law) and posts about novel subjects that we haven't seen in the subreddit before will be allowed for the time being. Please search the subreddit before posting anything related to AI.\n* **Have you checked the pinned posts?** - If you can't make a post, check the pinned posts before sending us modmail. We aren't going to enforce this 'rule', it's just informational to help direct people to the likely relevant information without having to go through modmail and wait for one of us to respond.\n* **Don't fake report things that should be modmail** - Don't report something to make a suggestion or a complaint about the sub on a sub-wide scale. Don't report something to ask us to change things. The correct thing to do in those situations is to send us modmail. If you don't know how to do that, please check [this mod post](https://old.reddit.com/r/AO3/s/Dxmqxx0K5x) for instructions.\n* **Research Studies are allowed** - Research Studies are *allowed* to be posted here and you do not need to ask prior to posting. All posts are subject to normal sub rules. Please use the 'Research Studies' flair for all studies and/or results. Studies must be related to something fandom, literature, or sexuality/gender, etc. in some way. If you have questions, feel free to send modmail.\n* **Moderator Discretion** - We are very open to what kinds of things can be posted here but we leave most things up to moderator discretion. The mod team discusses most changes and moderating decisions and ultimately everything is on a case-by-case basis. There are too many edge-cases to account for every situation. If something becomes a continual issue we will make a written rule about it.\n**Official AO3 presence on social media:**\n* **Twitter**: [@AO3org](https://twitter.com/AO3org); status update twitter is [@AO3_Status](https://twitter.com/AO3_Status).\n* **Tumblr**: [ao3org](http://ao3org.tumblr.com/)\n* **Tag Wrangling Specific Twitter**: [@ao3_wranglers](https://twitter.com/ao3_wranglers); Updates on certain tags that will be experiencing changes, and occasionally answers to questions about Tag Wrangling.\n---\n\u0026gt;**Helpful Stuff:**\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Useful Websites**\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;* [Down For Everyone or Just Me?](https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/archive-of-our-own) Determine whether a website is down or if it's just your faulty connection.

Don't be a jerk. That includes insulting other people for team allegiance, or giving knowingly wrong answers based on team rivalries or memes or whatever. Everyone has a right to ask questions and learn.\n2. Any question about American football is basically acceptable, but most fans and most posters here are primarily familiar with the NFL.\n3. This isn't really a place to try and argue an opinion. For example, it would be fair to ask, \"why do people seem to hold Player A in higher regard than Player B, even though I looked them up and they have similar numbers?\" but something like, \"Player B is better than Player A, change my mind\" probably won't stick around.\n4. Self-promotion of your website or blog or YouTube channel is frowned upon and those posts are typically removed. OC isn't *automatically* banned, but the point of this subreddit is for people to ask questions about football, not to advertise your football-related works.\n5. Posts about illegally streaming NFL games will be removed. Reddit has cracked down on subs that traffic in illegal streams of sporting events, and we'd much prefer to keep this one open.\n***There are no stupid questions here.***\nAre you an amateur player looking for advice on physical training or trying to make a school team?

[iClarified](http://www.iclarified.com)\n# [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/wiki/rules)\n### 1. r/jailbreak does not allow piracy tools, sources, or websites. \n\u0026gt;**1A.** No pirated tweaks, apps, etc. Please also do not post or advertise products, mirrors or services that are in violation of the copyrights/trademarks of others. [Why?](/r/jailbreak/wiki/rules#wiki_explanation_of_our_piracy_rule)\n\u0026gt;**1B.** Please do not name, share or discuss unauthorized signing services on r/jailbreak. **ONLY [jailbreaks.app](https://jailbreaks.app/) is allowed.** \n\u0026gt; Many signing services host apps that are pirated from the App Store, rehosted without the permission of the developer, or maliciously modified. [Why?](https://redd.it/91w74c/)\n\u0026gt;**1C.** Do not attempt to deliberately bypass our piracy filters. Doing so will result in a temporary or permanent ban. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/efuuvz/meta_new_bypass_rule/) for more information.\n### 2. Theming-related posts belong in r/iOSthemes.\n\u0026gt;Themes (and theme-related questions or news), setup showcases, and all questions regarding aesthetic-oriented tweaks should be posted in r/iOSthemes. \n### 3. No misleading/all-caps titles. Titles must contain at least three words and include a Flair.\n\u0026gt;Use detailed titles for both news and questions. Also, link to the source of news, such as the developer who made the announcement, instead of linking to blogspam.\n### 4. No exceptionally low-effort posts.\n\u0026gt;Memes, image macros, DAE posts, karma-farming, shitposts, etc. are not allowed here. Similar low-quality/low-effort posts will be removed at the mods' discretion. Please read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_5.3A_dank_memes_.26amp.3B_low-effort_content) for clarification.\n### 5. No posts or comments about bypassing passcodes or other device locks/restrictions.\n\u0026gt; Posts or comments about removing passcodes from locked devices or bypassing locks such as Activation Lock, IMEI lock, iCloud lock, MDM restrictions, etc. are prohibited. \n\u0026gt; History has shown that these situations usually involve a device that is stolen or otherwise not fully/legally owned by the user. The mods are not able to verify individual cases, so to avoid potentially facilitating theft or fraud, the topic is prohibited altogether.\n\u0026gt; This rule applies also for MacOS and checkra1n.\n### 6. Do not buy/sell devices or ask for money. \n\u0026gt;You may discuss the *general topic* of buying/selling devices, but advertising your own device(s) for sale, asking if anyone will sell you a device, asking how much your device is worth, etc. is not allowed. Asking for money or crowdfunding for any purpose without explicit permission is not allowed ([with some exceptions](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_6.3A_asking_for_money_.26amp.3B_selling_devices)).\n\u0026gt; If you wish to buy/sell a jailbroken device, visit r/jailbreakswap.\n\u0026gt; If you wish to request donations or crowdfunding, please [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fjailbreak\u0026amp;subject=Crowdfunding%2FDonation%20Request\u0026amp;message=) first for permission.\n### 7. Be civil and friendly. \n\u0026gt;**7A.** No insulting/rude comments or posts. Additionally, do not be rude or unhelpful when responding to posts tagged [Question].\n\u0026gt;**7B.** No racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, etc. comments or posts. Any user that targets hate at another user/group based on sex, race, religion, sexual/gender orientation, etc., as defined by [reddit's policy on hate based on identity or vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045715951), will receive an immediate permanent ban without warning.\n### 8. Topic must be jailbreak-related. \n\u0026gt;Posts must be directly related to iOS jailbreaking (with [some exceptions](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/wiki/rules#wiki_posts_not_related_to_ios_jailbreaking.)).\n### 9. Please read the FAQ, read the sidebar, and search before posting.\n\u0026gt;Posts that ask the most frequently asked questions will be removed by moderators, as they are either answered in our [FAQ](/r/jailbreak/wiki/faq) or on the sidebar.\n### 10. Avoid fueling excessive drama.\n\u0026gt; Anyone who participates on the sub *solely* for the sake of starting or continuing drama will be banned.

Tourism and travel related questions should be posted to the dedicated subreddit /r/ThailandTourism;\n3. Posts in English and/or Thai are welcome, submissions and comments in other languages will be removed;\n4. Reddiquette is enforced.

Overt and purposefully offensive or racist content and comments, including such comments directed at individual users. Purposefully derailing threads, harassing users, targeting users, and/or posting personal information about users on this sub or other subs, will not be tolerated if discovered;\n6. Posts which include illegal content will be removed, including posts regarding illegal drugs, sex tourism, and anything that is considered lese majeste in Thailand i.e. anything that might cause real trouble for users living in Thailand;\n7. News links should be direct to reputable news websites rather than tabloid sources or sites that reword or copy articles in order to drive traffic to their sites, e.g. Thaiger. Avoid clickbait, articles that are misleading in order to drive traffic or discussion. Do not alter headlines or post intentionally misleading information. When posting news stories, you must include the original headline first. You may add your own commentary after the headline (separated by e.g. \":\" or \"-\"), or in a separate comment on the post;\n9. Personal blogs, vacation videos, personal video channels, Instagram, Patreon, Gofundme, and so are prohibited;\n10. Spam if not caught by the Reddit spam filter will be removed and may result in a ban without warning.

We have a monthly pinned thread for the most **frequently asked questions** on this sub. Please read it before posting, to avoid having your post removed if it belongs over there;\n12. Posts and questions about COVID-19 are welcome, if relevant to Thailand. Anti-mask or anti-vax arguments are not, please don't post those here;\n13. Requests for relationship advice should be posted to a relationship subreddit (e.g. /r/Relationship_Advice). Posts about dating, dating apps/websites, or where to meet partners are not welcome on this subreddit and will be removed;\n14. Posts using the \"serious\" are more heavily moderated and joking or off topic replies will be removed;\n15. Questions related to specific non-Thai cultures should be posted on an appropriate subreddit for that culture, not here;\n16. Posts or questions that are phrased to induce/promote hate or negativity are also not welcome;\nQuestions or comments regarding about rules or moderation should be directed to moderators use the “message the moderators” link below. \n \n# Links\n### Related Subreddits\n* /r/bangkok\n* /r/chiangmai\n* /r/phuket\n* /r/malaysia\n* /r/vietnam\n* /r/cambodia\n* /r/laos\n* /r/burma\n* /r/asean\n* /r/thailandpics\n* /r/thaithai\n### News\n* [Bangkok Post](https://www.bangkokpost.com/)\n* [Prachatai English](https://prachatai.com/english/)\n* [Thai Enquirer](https://www.thaienquirer.com/)\n* [Thai PBS World](https://www.thaipbsworld.com/)\n* [The Nation](https://www.nationthailand.com/)\n### Travel\n* [Thailand Tourism Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism)\n* [Wikivoyage](http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Thailand)\n* [Trains](http://www.seat61.com/Thailand.htm)\n### Teaching\n* [Ajarn.com](http://www.ajarn.com/)\n* [TeachingThailand.com](http://teachingthailand.com)\n### Jobs\n* [JobsDB](http://www.jobsdb.co.th/)\n* [Jobtopgun](https://www.jobtopgun.com/?view=index\u0026amp;locale=en_TH)\n* [Siamdigitaljob](https://www.siamdigitaljob.com/)\n* [Workventure](https://www.workventure.com/en)\n* [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com)\n* [Glassdoor](http://www.glassdoor.com)\n### Learning Thai\n* /r/learnthai\n* [thai-language.com](http://thai-language.com/) ([advanced dictionary](http://thai-language.com/dict))\n* [www.seasite.niu.edu/thai](http://www.seasite.niu.edu/thai/)\n* [www.expatden.com/learn-thai/](https://www.expatden.com/learn-thai/)"},{"display_name":"RealTesla","description":"If you're interested in discussing the polarizing, ongoing soap opera that is Tesla, but you refuse to drink the Tesla Cult Kool-Aid, this is the place for you. We aren't \"neutral\", we are generally quite dubious of the claims made by Tesla and their leadership, and have some fun at their expense. Positive views on the company are not only accepted, they are encouraged - but only with data to support claims made. Fans of Tesla looking to make honest counterpoints to the skepticism will be welcomed and protected by the mods - but fanboi trolls will be banned faster than Elon can lie about FSD.\nOne of the core values of r/RealTesla is transparency. \n**All moderator activity is recorded and publicly viewable [here](https://modlogs.fyi/r/RealTesla).**\n**RULES:**\n**1)** Posts, both text and link, must relate to Tesla or the EV or AV market space in which they compete. Posts about the automotive industry in general **must** be accompanied by a comment from OP explaining how it relates to Tesla.\nAny post that does not meet the requirements of Rule 1, but is related to Tesla's sister companies, Elon Musk, or Tesla fan(boi)s, must be flaired as **TESLAGENTIAL**, or it will be removed. \n**2)** Meta posts discussing the subreddit itself need to be pre-approved by a Moderator, and will be flaired as such.\n**3)** Posts whose intent is humor (not information or discussion) must be flaired as a **SHITPOST**. The moderation team will curate Shitposts so that no more than a few are on the front page at a given time. It is acceptable to put whatever title you want on original content Shitpost images that are memes/photoshops/etc intended to be humorous.\n**4)** No mindless, pro-Elon \"Tesla will rule the world\" fandom. Opining Tesla will in fact make millions of cars each year and dominate the industry is acceptable - actually encouraged (with reasoning), as it provides a nice balance and perspective against our admittedly skeptical slant. But gushing over the greatness of Elon, isn't allowed - Reddit has enough of it already.\n**5)** ALL LINKS MUST INCLUDE THE ORIGINAL TITLE OF THE CONTENT - Crossposts from within Reddit must be flaired as such, and cannot change the original title. Titles that are (for some reason) in all CAPS can be de-capitalized to avoid eye trauma.\n**Links to tweets** must be the text of the tweet itself (or a truncated version thereof). You can pick a portion of the tweet as your title, as long as the context isn't misleading.\n**Links to forum posts** must also contain the text of the forum post headline. If there is no headline, the top (OP) post must be quoted in the link title.\n**Crossposts** must be flaired and maintain the original title.\nYou cannot post a link as a self-post to get around filters, or highlight your own comment as the body of the self-post along with the link. Self-posts are for written, non-linked content only.\nIf you have a zinger you just can't hold back, add it as a comment immediately after your post. \n**6)** Any link to content behind a paywall (including Seeking Alpha) must have the entire text of the article included in the comments. Failure to do so will have the post removed.\nArticles from restricted sites must be cleared with moderators in advance of posting. \nCurrent restricted sites :\n- Zero Hedge \n- Teslarati\n**7)** The following behaviors in the comment section will lead to warnings/bans, and removal of comments :\n- excessively criticizing users, moderators, or r/RealTesla. Constructive comments should far outnumber attacks on others\n- any comment made that implies or presumes that a given user or the sub in general is long/short TSLA stock; generic references to \"bulls\" and \"bears\" is ok.\n- using the word FUD non-ironically. It's tired and meaningless.\n**8)** Images of text are not allowed. Screen captures modified to show information (for instance, a screenshot of a Tesla online order page) are acceptable, but screenshots of tweets, forums, or anything else that could have been linked will be removed, and repeat offenders will be banned.\n**9)** Posts made for the purpose of discussing other subreddits are not allowed. This includes discussions about being banned, screenshots of discussions with mods of other subreddits, or anything of the sort.\n We don't need or want the drama, let's enjoy what we have here and leave it at that.\nLastly, please use available flairs for RUMORS and OWNER EXPERIENCES when appropriate...\nFor more on the history and philosophy of the subreddit, you can [check out the Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/wiki/index) (in progress).\n##[JOIN THE REALTESLA CHAT HERE!!](https://s.reddit.com/channel/227985_07d9ee541e7c35713b2daa7c8315f64057b9666c)"},{"display_name":"MSI_Gaming","description":"Welcome to MSI Gaming’s subreddit!

Observe good [Reddiquette](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette), especially remember the human, attack ideas not people, and don't be rude, don't troll, don't spam. Do not ever submit any NSFW/NSFL content,even if marked. * Profanity is not allowed in post titles. * Do not beg for karma\n2. **Stay on topic.** All submissions to r/fountainpens must relate to one or more of the following: the hobby of fountain pens, the greater fountain pen community, (e.g., inks, papers, accessories, etc.), and/or the career of significant fountain pen community members, including (but not limited to) major retailers, manufacturers, and primarily fountain pen-based influencers or social media personalities.\n3. **No recent reposts.** If a post has been made in the past 14 days, do not make it again. Instead, use the subreddit search function before posting to make sure that it is an original post. In some situations, posting about a topic again can be appropriate if a substantial amount of time has passed, or if there are new or significant updates that warrant their own submission.\n4. **AMAs and surveys must have prior approval.** Before posting an AMA, please get moderator approval. You will be required to prove who you are in some way. Before posting a survey, please get moderator approval. As long as the survey is directly related to the hobby of fountain pens or its community, it will likely be approved. Single-question surveys, such as straw polls, do not need moderator approval.\n5. **No transactions.** Do not use r/fountainpens as a platform for any sort of transaction for money or other value. Links to a page that offer a product or service are allowed, as long as the transaction is external from the r/fountainpens platform. (NOTE: certain domains may be blocked by Reddit by default.) If you are looking to sell your pens, please go to r/Pen_Swap, our awesome sister subreddit for buying, selling, and trading pens and ink.\n6. **Contests and giveaways must have prior approval.** Prior approval from a moderator is required for all giveaway posts. Large giveaways or contests may be stickied with moderator approval for a maximum of seven (7) days. Small giveaways or pay-it-forward posts may also be posted on r/pen_swap.\n7. **Vendors and Self-Promotion.** Vendors who engage in the community with discussions are more than welcome, but vendors who only self-promote are not. For more information, see the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/wiki/index#wiki_vendors). Sellers, makers, and retailers must be transparent about their affiliation.

Startups utilize tech to do this. Startups can be non-tech companies that utilize tech. Startups are information era companies and they are creating the new best practices in business. \n####/r/startups \nWe share interesting discussions and stories about our startup journeys, both the failures, the successes, and the embarrassments. **Our best traits are authenticity and integrity.**\n----\n#Rules\n#####1.Relevant Content Only\nWe are a community of discussion based around startups, not traditional businesses.\nAll content must be relevant to startups.\nYou are welcome to ask how to apply startup methodologies to your traditional business if you frame your question in a non-promotional way. We want you to be able to ask any question that helps your startup.\n#####2.No direct sales, advertisements, or promotion\n**No direct sales, advertisements, or promotional posts of any kind**. We have designated places that are an exception to this rule and they will always be stickied at the top of /r/startups.\n* You MAY share your startup in the Share Your Startup thread\nSelf-promotion is anything you have an interest, stake or relationship with including being friends with someone at the company.\nAt the end of the day, /r/startups moderators have the final say if your comments are promotional or not.\n#####3.Submissions Serve a Specific Purpose\nSubmissions are for discussing methodologies, experiences, tactics, strategies, techniques, markets, and other such things WITHOUT tying them directly to your own project using its name or URL.\nTitles must be clear and descriptive.\nSubmissions must have at least 250 characters of content. The more details you provide us the better support our community can provide you with. Life life, the more you put into something the more you get out of it.\n#####4.Feedback Has a Place\nAll Feedback Requests (including surveys/polls) belong in our [Feedback Thread or other appropriate weekly thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/boq669/your_weekly_threads_guide_learn_about_the_new/)\nYou are invited to repost each week. \nBe sure to contribute to the others in the thread and ask them to return the favor to increase engagement.\nYou may not publicly offer feedback or direct support outside of the Stickied Threads.\n#####5.Rules for Links in Comments/Discussions\nSometimes you think the best solution is simply to link to a resource that might answer someone's question. We want you to be able to link in discussion to relevant content. We also don't want the discussion to turn into a self promotional mess and link farm.\nIf you are going to link to something in the comments please make sure to:\n* Write at least a sentence explaining why the link is relevant to the discussion.\n* Link only content you have no affiliation with. Affiliate links = banned.\n#####6.Do Not Solicit PM Requests\nThe purpose of making a submission or comment is to engage in a public discussion with the community. \nIt is not to request a message from someone. \nYou are more than welcome to engage privately with one another, but it is up to you to take the initiative directly.\n#####7.Sharing Your Blog is To Start a Discussion\nSharing your blog is not a means to self promote.\nA link to the original blog post is allowed with **prior** Mod approval.\nIf you are submitting your own blog content, the full body of the content must be included in the post, properly formatted for reddit.\nInclude an outline \u0026amp; timestamps with a video.\nIf your blog is over 2000 words you may ask for an exemption.\nAll other rules still apply.\nNo blogs about your \"startup\" journey allowed.\n#####8.Always Be Kind and Supportive\nThe goal of this community is to encourage people to learn and be inspired to pursue ventures related to startups.\nDo not troll, harass people, or be an asshole. **This does not mean to lie. It means to give support and explain why you don't like something.**\nTry to remember people likely do not have much experience yet or might be simply ignorant to what you know.\nBe willing to hold a discussion and try to explain your opinion or point of view to the benefit of the entire community.\n#####9.No Unscheduled AMAs\nWe do not allow unscheduled AMAs.\nWe need to verify and approve all AMAs. \nIf you wish to do an AMA you must use the \"Message the Moderators\" feature in the side bar and you must give us at least TWO (2) Weeks Lead Time to organize it with you.\n----\n#Similar communities\n* /r/entrepreneur\n* /r/forhire \n* /r/kickstarter\n* /r/business\n* /r/hwstartups\n* /r/smallbusiness\n* /r/marketing\n* /r/sideproject\n* /r/growmybusiness\n* /r/shutdown (startup graveyard)\n* /r/venturedcapital \n \n* /r/AlphaAndBetaUsers (post your 'can you test my new product' posts here!) \n \n* /r/telecommuting (subreddit about remotely working) \n \n* *Want more?* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/newest)\n#Notable AMA's\n* [Emperor Alexis Ohanian](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/)\n* [Founders of the Startup Institute](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1e30yq/were_the_founders_of_startup_institute_aaron/)\n* [Jaan Tallinn, Skype co-founder](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fuzwt/im_jaan_tallinn_cofounder_of_skype_kazaa_cser_and/)\n* [Imgur Founder](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y81ju/i_created_imgur_ama/)\n* [Mozilla Contributer](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oif/we_are_mozilla_aua/)\n* [Silicon Valley Venture Capitalist](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9s5k3/iama_i_am_a_highprofile_silicon_valley_venture/)\n----\n**[Previous Share your Startup threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+share+your+startup+self%3Ayes\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;t=all)**\n---\nNew to the scene?

Length will be at the moderator's discretion. This is a subreddit to discuss movies, not to fight your political battles. Keep it nice, keep it on-topic. \n***Improving Titles:***\n\u0026gt; Going forward, we will be requiring better and more detailed titles. Titles have gotten extremely lazy and clickbaity. Every title will now *require* the name of the actor/actress/director you are discussing *plus* the name of the movie title in the image. No more trying to guess what OP is talking about, or clickbaiting into going into the post. Include the actor/actress' name, and movie title. It's very simple. Takes 2 seconds, and will immensely improve the quality-of-life for the sub. There will be exemptions for posts that aren't about 1 specific movie or 1 specific person, but we will still encourage better titles no matter what, as they're currently 99% shit.\n***Restricting Recent Duplicates:***\n\u0026gt; To stop the repetitive/nonstop spam posts of the same actors over and over, we will be removing \"recent\" duplicates. We do not need an 8th Salma Hayek post this week. If a topic (aka actor/actress/director) has already been submitted in the past month, it will be removed. We believe one month is a fair amount of time in-between related posts. Not too long, not too short.\n***Anti-Gooning/Shitpost Measures:***\n\u0026gt; It's no secret that this sub has turned into goon-central. Posts are basically \"who can post the most cleavage\". Lots of paparazzi-like pictures, red carpet photos, modeling images, etc infesting the sub. Going forward, we will require *every* post to either be an official HD still of a film or the official IMDB image of the actor/actress. No exceptions. No more out-of-context half naked pictures of an actress out in the wild. Every submission must be an official still of the film or their IMDB profile picture. In addition to anti-gooning, we will be cutting down on overall shitposts overall. This will be totally up to the moderator's discretion.\n***Collaborations with Other Film-Related Communities:***\n\u0026gt; We will be collaborating with other film-related communities to try and bring more solid content to this community, including and not restricted to AMAs/Q\u0026amp;As, box office data, and movie news. Places like /r/movies, /r/boxoffice, etc. This will be wide-ranging and not as restricted/limited as those other communities, allowing stories here that may not be allowed in those communities due to strict rules. We will encourage crossposting to build discussion here.\n***Removing Bots, Karma-Farming Accounts, Bad-Faith Members of the Community***\n\u0026gt; We will start issuing bans to rulebreakers. This will range from perm bans (bots, karma-farming accounts, spammers) to temporary bans (rude behavior, breaking the new rules constantly, etc)\n# Related subreddits\n* /r/Movies\n* /r/MovieSuggestions \n* /r/Trailers \n* /r/FilmTalk\n* /r/IJustWatched\n* /r/Ebert\n---\nSee our previous [top scoring links](http://www.reddit.com/r/moviecritic/top/?t=all).\n---\nspoiler tags: [Spoiler stuff](/spoiler)\n code: [spoiler stuff](/spoiler)"},{"display_name":"furry","description":"\u0026gt;* **Filter By...**\n* [All Posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/furry)\n* [SFW Only](http://so.reddit.com/r/furry)\n* [Discussion](/r/furry/search?q=flair%3ADiscussion\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on)\n* [Convention](/r/furry/search?q=flair%3Aconvention\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on)\n* [Comic](/r/furry/search?q=flair%3Acomic\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on)\n* [Fursuit](/r/furry/search?q=flair%3Afursuit\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on)\n* [Music](/r/furry/search?q=flair%3Amusic\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on)\n* [Video](/r/furry/search?q=flair%3Avideo\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on)\n* [Gif](/r/furry/search?q=flair%3Agif\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on)\n* [Writing](/r/furry/search?q=flair%3AWriting\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on)\n* [Link](/r/furry/search?q=flair%3Alink\u0026amp;sort=new\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on)\nWelcome to /r/furry!

This will grant you a permanent ban from the sub.\n* c) When writing in Spanish, take care of your spelling, grammar, and punctuation (this includes full accents, as well as '¿' and '¡' symbols) as learners are paying close attention to your comments and how you're using the language.\n4.

Default Mac keyboards do not require any additional layout, a combination of the Option key with other different keys (e.g. vowels) are used to get the symbols.\n## On a phone or tablet\n* Methods will vary according to the operating system, but normally adding a Spanish keyboard and long-pressing the appropriate keys will display a box, allowing to choose the desired symbol.\nOr you can use the table below for quick copy-paste:\n||||||\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|\u0026amp;#193;|\u0026amp;#201;|\u0026amp;#205;|\u0026amp;#211;|\u0026amp;#218;|\n|\u0026amp;#225;|\u0026amp;#233;|\u0026amp;#237;|\u0026amp;#243;|\u0026amp;#250;|\n|\u0026amp;#220;|\u0026amp;#252;|\u0026amp;#209;|\u0026amp;#241;|\u0026amp;#191; \u0026amp;#161;|\n---\n#Related Subreddits\n* **[List of subreddits in Spanish](/r/Spanish/w/subreddits)** (curated by this sub)\n* /r/languagelearning: General discussion about language learning.\n* /r/linguistics: Languages from a scientific point of view.\n* /r/translator: For all your translation needs.\n* /r/JudgeMyAccent: A place to submit an audio and receive feedback on your pronunciation, accent, etc."},{"display_name":"arduino","description":"A reddit for all things Arduino.\n________________________\nr/Arduino Information:\n* [Rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/arduino/about/rules/)\n* [Wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/arduino/wiki/index)\n* [Live Chat](https://chat.reddit.com/room/!VGFShsW8RMWQ78I4TYqVSQ:reddit.com) (new!)\n________________________\nArduino Information:\n* [r/Arduino Wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/arduino/wiki/index)\n* [User Project Series We Love!](https://old.reddit.com/r/arduino/collection/1f7184de-139b-438c-8223-54ed9fb98458/)\n* [Language Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/)\n* [Tutorials Homepage](https://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage)\n* [Top Arduino Libraries](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/)\n* [Arduino to Breadboard](https://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoToBreadboard)\n* [Arduino Forum](https://arduino.cc/forum/)\n* [Arduino IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net?channels=arduino)\n* [Arduino Twitter Feed](https://twitter.com/arduino)\n________________________\nRelated Subreddits:\n* [Arduino AI](https://old.reddit.com/r/arduino_ai)\n* [AskElectronics](https://old.reddit.com/r/askelectronics)\n* [Embedded](https://old.reddit.com/r/embedded)\n* [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://old.reddit.com/r/ece)\n* [Electronics](https://old.reddit.com/r/electronics)\n* [Electrical Engineering Books](https://old.reddit.com/r/eebooks)\n* [Component Exchange](https://old.reddit.com/r/ECEComponentExchange)\n* [Arduino Memes](https://old.reddit.com/r/arduino_memes)\n________________________\nBeginners:\n* [Beginner Kits](https://old.reddit.com/r/arduino/search?q=kit\u0026amp;restrict_sr=on)\n* [Parts List](https://old.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/erdnp/got_an_arduino_uno_for_christmas_but/c1abg6g)\n* [Online/Text Resources](https://old.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/ezlzb/whats_the_best_book_or_website_for_absolute/) \n* [Tutorials](https://redd.it/fhdsd)\n________________________\nWhere to buy:\n* [Arduino](https://store.arduino.cc)\n* [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/)\n* [Adafruit](https://adafruit.com/)\n* [SeeedStudio](https://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/)\n________________________\nTools / References:\n* [Connector Identification](https://connectorbook.com/identification.html?m=NN)\n* [Online Circuit Simulator](http://www.falstad.com/circuit/)\n* [Wokwi Arduino Simulator](https://wokwi.com/) ✨ New!\n* [Component Search](http://octopart.com/)\n* [Eagle PCB Design](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download)\n* [Arduino Project Hub](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub)\n* [Arduino Create](https://create.arduino.cc/)"},{"display_name":"CarSalesTraining","description":"Let's help each other do better in our careers.

Following them avoids automated filtering or moderator intervention or removal of posts or comments. \u0026amp;nbsp; \n1. **Civility and respectful conversation**. \n1. **New traders**: Use the **[Options Questions Safe Haven](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/subreddit_resources)** weekly thread for basic questions, and read the educational links there. \n1. **No off-topic or low-options-content posts**. Low-effort posts are subject to removal. This includes wall-of-text-posts and posts consisting of mostly links with no narrative, and repetitious comments. \n1. **No low-effort posts.** **[Give sufficient details](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/trade_details)** about your option strategy and trade to discuss it. This is a courtesy to readers. \n1. **No spam, no cross-posting, no copy/pasting across multiple subreddits** Your post should be composed for, and align the values of this subreddit. \n1. **No promotions, referrals, or solicitations of any kind. No chat room links.** No trading room / chat / Discord / or offerings or requests for contact via DM/PM. No self-promotion of channels or apps. No repeated posts. **On-topic links are acceptable.** \n1. **Link-posts are filtered (images, screenshots, videos, web links)** and require mod approval. Text-posts with narrative and detailed citations and description of the linked or hosted elsewhere image are expected. No Memes. URL shorteners are not allowed. \n1. **Don't ask for trades**. Low effort posts amounting to \"Ticker?\" are taken down. Think for yourself. Put forward an analysis, general strategy, trade rationale and option **[position details \u0026amp; exit plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/trade_details)** for critique and discussion. \n1. **Not a trading journal**. Posts of gains, losses, list of trades, trade images without **[narrative strategy and trade details](/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/trade_details)**, or a repeating series of posts as if you were blogging, are taken down.\n1. **Don't post FAQs (Frequently Answered Questions) as new threads**: New threads that ask the same type of question repeatedly push new topics off of the front page. We have a wiki with a FAQ section that you can check first, and we have a weekly Q\u0026amp;A thread where frequently asked questions are welcome. \n1. **No profanity in post titles**. \n1. **Minimum account age \u0026amp; posting karma required**: IDs older than 5 days, no very low or negative posting/comment karma.\n1. **Title your post informatively with particulars.** This courtesy to readers enables the archived post to be found again later. Disclose the TICKER and position. Posts titled \"Help\", \"First Trade\" \"What should I do?\", \"What am I missing\" or \"Advice\" are removed. \n1. **Moderators may, at their discretion, allow posts and comments to remain visible.** The rules are advisory to the moderators and subject to reasonable judgment.\n\u0026amp;nbsp; \n**Report posts or comments not meeting community standards with the \"report\" link.** \n\u0026amp;nbsp; \n**[Complete Guide \u0026amp; Rules for posting](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/about/rules)** \n\u0026amp;nbsp; \n**[Option trade details needed when posting](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/trade_details)** \n\u0026amp;nbsp; \n**[Moderator Mail messages Moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=r/options)** \n*****************************\n####[](#h4-green)\n\u0026gt;**Useful Information** \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[Options Questions Safe Haven](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/subreddit_resources) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[Toolbox \u0026amp; Links (wiki)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/toolbox/links/) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[FAQs (wiki)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/index) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[Glossary](https://www.optionseducation.org/referencelibrary/optionsglossary) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[Gude to effective options posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/trade_details) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[Book Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/8qfs14/options_book_list_review_of_all_books_that_helped/) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[Call Options 101](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnl3x1wo25g) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[Put Options 101](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CUcgUeQS-w) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[Implied Volatility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIHldsSmASU) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[Long Calls](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkenESb7BY4\u0026amp;list=PLdxCq_m79KK9zccgQ-RmvWvkZ0LBgi7Ch) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[The Options Playbook](http://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[Strategy Overview]\n(https://www.optionsbro.com/basic-options-strategies/) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[TastyTrade Helpful Page](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn?locale=en-US) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[CBOE Options Institute](http://www.cboe.com/learnCenter/OptionsInstitute1.aspx) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[CBOE Webcasts]\n(http://www.cboe.com/education/webcasts) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[CBOE Index Settlement Values](https://www.cboe.com/data/settlement.aspx) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[Streaming Futures Quotes](http://www.investing.com/indices/indices-futures) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[VIX index \u0026amp; VX futures](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/6yhiuy/vix_vix_contract_pricing_and_vx/) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[VIX Futures for Contract Pricing](https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-vix-futures) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[Economic Calendar](http://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[USA Options Brokers (wiki)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/brokers) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[A list of international brokers trading USA (\u0026amp; European) options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/brokers/) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[Historical Options Data, Option Chains \u0026amp; more (wiki)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/data_sources) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[Option Adjustments: Stock Splits, Mergers \u0026amp; Special Dividends (wiki)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq#wiki_option_adjustments.3A_splits.2C_mergers.2C_special_dividends.2C_and_more) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[Wash Sales, an introduction (wiki)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/wash_sales) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[Why did my options lose value when the stock price moved favorably? -- Options extrinsic and intrinsic value, an introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/extrinsic_value) \n•\u0026amp;nbsp;[Why option stop loss orders are a bad idea](\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/stop_loss) \n \n*****************************\n\u0026gt;**Option Pros** \nUsers tagged with 'Options Pro' flair have demonstrated considerable knowledge on option trading.
